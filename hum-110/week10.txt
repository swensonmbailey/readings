THE REVOLUTIONS
______________________________________________________
hen William and Mary ascended the British throne in 1688, it
was hailed as “the Glorious Revolution” for no blood had been
shed, and the British had a nation with greater political
freedom than any other in Europe. Their coronation was quickly
followed by a Declaration of Rights that guaranteed things like trial by
jury and parliamentary representation to all British citizens. John
Locke, the author and philosopher who supplied much of the
intellectual foundation of the Glorious Revolution, wrote in his Second
Treatise on Government:
Man being born, as has been proved, with a title to perfect
freedom, and an uncontrolled enjoyment of all the rights and
privileges of the law of nature, equally with any other man, or
number of men in the world, hath by nature a power, not only to
preserve his property, that is, his life, liberty and estate, against
the injuries and attempts of other men.
Locke further contended that the role of government is to preserve
these rights and that the power of government is a result of the
individual citizens collectively agreeing to be ruled. In July of 1776, the
Virginian Thomas Jefferson would modify Locke’s treatment of natural
rights into the following words:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments
are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed.
Ironically, during this time of expanding liberty there was a
corresponding increase in monarchical power in other nations—
particularly France. Louis XIV ruled for so long—seventy-two years,
one of the longest European history—that his pattern of governance
came to be accepted as the way things were done. In an age when the
average life expectancy was somewhere between thirty-five and forty,
Louis reigned for multiple generations. His reign was so long that his

successor, Louis XV, was neither his son nor his grandson, but his
great-grandson.
Louis XV became king at the ripe old age of five and was on the throne
for the next fifty-eight years. Think of it, 130 years and only two kings.
This incredibly long period further created a sense of royal isolation
from the conditions of the non-noble classes. Still, the two Louis’s felt
that they were acting in the national best interest by living their lives
on public display, by championing a flamboyant and elegant lifestyle,
and by creating a standard of taste that would be the envy of all
Europe.
During the rule of Louis XV, the nobility of France, and by extension
the nobles of most of the rest of Europe, adopted a rather extreme
form of Baroque that came to be known as the Rococo. The new style
was a bit lighter, less formal, and less ponderous than the Baroque,
but it was still over-the-top. All spaces were to be ornamented; more
was better. The style soon spread to Southern Germany and Austria.
The painting, sculpture, architecture, and music of this period is highly
ornamented and theatrical; yet, it is still lighter and more trivial in
content. The power of the Baroque is gone. Instead of moving the
viewer, the art was to charm and entertain.

All of the Exploration and Colonization
WAR AND ENLIGHTENMENT All of the exploration and
colonization of the 1600s led to a fierce mercantile competitiveness in
the 1700s. Adam Smith (1723–1790) was a Scottish economist who
wrote the treatise An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth
of Nations. Smith advocated free market capitalism and encouraged
nations to make commerce the center of their national policy. The
British and French each built huge commercial empires—in North
America, in the Caribbean, in India, in the Pacific, and eventually in
Africa.
British/French competition led to a long series of wars, sometimes
referred to the Second Hundred Years War, that stretched from the
late 1600s to the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. This period featured
conflicts with colorful names like the War of Spanish Succession, the
French and Indian War, and the War of Jenkins’ Ear. In the Seven
Years War (1756–1763—known as the French and Indian War on this
side of the Atlantic), Britain won a tremendous victory, wresting both
Canada and India from France. France got revenge of sorts by backing
the rebellious American colonists in the War of American Independence
(1776–1783). The conflict between the two nations reached its peak
during the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte in France. Napoleon was able
to conquer most of the continent of Europe, but was unable to subdue
the British fleet. In the end British endurance paid off, and Napoleon
was defeated, captured, and exiled.
The flourishing commerce of the new age gave increased wealth and
power to the middle class, the bourgeoisie as the French call it, the
merchants and tradesmen and bankers of society. As this class
burgeoned in wealth, it sought commensurate power in the political
arena. One phenomenon of the rising middle class was the coffee
house. Coffee was a recently discovered import from the New World,
made palatable by Caribbean sugar. Coffee houses sprang up all over
England and France and the prosperous townspeople gathered there to
talk over intellectual and political theories.

At the center of intellectual dialogue during the 1700s was the idea of
the Enlightenment. According to the German philosopher Immanuel
Kant, the Enlightenment was the freedom to use one’s intelligence. At
its core was critical questioning of traditional institutions, customs, and
morals, and a strong belief in rationality and science. The middle-class
coffee house clientele was central to the climate in which these ideas
could flourish as it encouraged a new spirit of openness and
questioning of established authority and tradition.

The Treaty of Paris
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION In 1783, the Treaty of Paris
established American independence from Britain. A new republic was
born, based on life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Of course,
none of this would have been possible without French assistance.
American independence inspired the French to seek their own liberté,
egalité, and fraternité (brotherhood). The painter Jacques Louis David
(1748–1825) was as much a revolutionary as an artist. He spent
nearly three years in Rome working on a massive painting, The Oath
of the Horatii. Pictured are the sons of Horace in ancient Rome
swearing their allegiance to the Roman Republic. David and others
hoped that the American Revolution might spark something similar in
France. At the same time, David was inspired by Greek and Roman art
to simplify his paintings and rely more on form and balance. The new
style was called Neo-Classical.

Meanwhile, economic trouble was brewing. The huge cost of
supporting the American Revolution put an enormous strain on the
French treasury. Then came an extraordinarily bad harvest followed by
an exceptionally hard winter in 1788–89. Tax revenues dropped, and
the government faced a major financial crisis. The young new King
Louis XVI decided on a desperate political move. For the first time
since 1615, he convened a national assembly called the Estates
General. This assembly had no direct power to make law and create
policy. Rather, it served as an advisory/legislative body at the service
of the king. It was divided into three “estates” based on class that
were founded upon long-established principles. The First Estate was
the nobility, the Second was the clergy, and the Third was the landowning citizens and middle-class merchants.
The First and Second Estates paid no tax, so the burden of rescuing
France’s economy fell squarely on the shoulders of the people in the
greatest distress—the farmers and merchants of the nation. Fired by
the republican principles of the American Revolution, they went
beyond their instructions from the monarch and on 17 June 1789,
declared the Third Estate as having the power to create a national
constitution.
When the group went to meet in the chambers on June 20, they found
the doors locked and guarded by soldiers—perhaps the King felt they
had gone too far. The group simply moved into a nearby tennis court
and swore an oath to not disband until a new constitution was created.
A few nobles and clergy joined in. David painted the moment where
they swore the oath. He symbolically had the three estates embrace in
the foreground of the painting.

Within a few weeks the tension turned from oath-making to
shooting. On 14 July 1789, an armed mob stormed Paris’ symbol of
royal oppression—the Bastille, the royal prison, and armory. From this
they gained a supply of weapons to be used in the war that erupted.
The French Revolution shook not only France but all of Europe to its
core. In France, centuries of class animosity boiled over into
successive periods know as “terrors” where nobles slew peasants and
peasants sent thousands of nobles to their deaths. The guillotine was
the preferred method of execution, deemed more humane than the
axe because it removed the head with a single lop. Louis XVI
reluctantly agreed to a constitutional monarchy and greatly reduced
royal powers. He was forced to wear a revolutionary cap in public. Talk
became so anti-royalist that Louis began to fear for his life. In 1791,
he tried sneaking out of the country at about the same time his fatherin-law, the Emperor of Austria, invaded France to prevent anti-royalist
sentiment from moving beyond France’s borders. Louis was brought
back to Paris, tried for and convicted of treason, and beheaded in
January of 1793. Marie Antoinette, his widow, was beheaded a little
later.
Many nobles fled the country.
Others sought revenge. One of the
chief instigators of violence against
the nobility was a man named JeanPaul Marat. Marat was editor of a
newspaper that called for
slaughtering the nobility (he was
quoted as saying that to achieve
domestic tranquility 200,000 heads
ought to be severed). A supporter of
the former monarchy, Charlotte
Corday, gained entrance to Marat
through a letter of introduction. The
fiery writer had a painful skin
condition that caused him to spend
most days in a bathtub, writing at a
special desk he had built for it, so he David, Death of Marat, 1793
7 | T h e R e v o l u t i o n s
could soak and work at the same time. This was the scene when the
assassin surprised him and stabbed him to death (note the bloody
knife on the floor).
The news of his murder spread like wildfire. David, the great painter
and revolutionary was called to do a painting of the dead hero and
painted Marat as a sort of calm martyr. The letter of introduction is
carefully placed in one hand while his pen, which wrote such powerful
revolutionary prose, is drooping in the other. The background is highly
simplified—a long way from the swelling atmosphere of a Baroque
work. Marat is drawn with great attention to precise detail, with fabric
textures and other surfaces painted with extreme care.

The French Revolution
THE RISE OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE Before the French
Revolution, the only way a military man could achieve a high rank was
to be of noble birth. The Revolution changed all of that. Not only were
commoners now allowed to move up the ranks, but there was plenty
of opportunity for them to distinguish themselves in military action,
since the army had to both maintain order within France and defend its
borders against the crown heads of Europe who were determined to
snuff out the Revolution. In 1795, a young major from the island of
Corsica was promoted to general after using artillery to crush a French
mob protesting the cruelty of the new regime. Soon Napoleon
Bonaparte was winning victories against an Austrian army in Italy, and
even came back a hero from an ill-planned excursion to Egypt. After
his Egyptian adventure, he was made a member of Directory, the
executive branch of the government. In 1799, he seized full power and
had himself appointed “First Consul,” a title drawn from ancient Rome.
Even while he was dismantling the French Republic, Napoleon won
victory after victory over France’s enemies. In 1803, his popularity was
so great that he was able to declare himself emperor, inviting the pope
to Paris for a coronation. Symbolic of his own self-guided rise to
power, he took the crown from the pope’s hands and placed it on his
own head. He then took another crown and placed it on the head of his
wife, Josephine, crowning her empress. Again, David records the
event:

 In a little more than a decade, France had self-consciously
mimicked the thousand-year history of Rome, from kingdom to
republic to empire. Art, architecture, and even fashion assumed a
Roman style. Here the new emperor sits in the style of ancient Rome,
painted with extreme care by Jean Auguste Dominque Ingres (1780–
1867), a pupil of David:

Many of the movers and shakers in the new republic in America,
including Thomas Jefferson, admired the French and their tastes
(remember that they wouldn’t have achieved independence without
them). This admiration translated into a Neo-Classical style in
American architecture, especially in public buildings. There is hardly a
state capital in the US that doesn’t feature the columns, porches, and
domes of Greek and Roman temples.
