“WE SEEK AFTER THESE THINGS”: AN
INTRODUCTION TO A STUDY OF THE ARTS
______________________________________________________
As you begin your formal education at Brigham Young University
Idaho there are probably many questions running through your
mind concerning the classes you take. It’s probably easy to
understand why many of the Foundations courses are required. Writing
is important to people in every walk of life. We use math in many
settings from the kitchen to the business ledger. The US Constitution
and the tradition of rule of law have had a tremendous influence on
nations well beyond the borders of the United States. In our
technology-driven world we are bombarded with science and pseudoscience—we really need to be able to tell them apart. As travel and
communication have become easier, an understanding of other
cultures can make us better equipped to deal with the people we meet
in business, in church, or on the street. But why the arts? Why does
the Church Board of Education allot tithing dollars so that all BYUIdaho students can study the fine arts? Many of the answers to this
question are found in the scriptures.
In Doctrine and Covenants Section 88 we read:
78 Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may
be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in
the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of
God, that are expedient for you to understand;
79 Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth;
things which have been, things which are, things which must
shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are
abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the
judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries
and of kingdoms—
80 That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you
again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the
mission with which I have commissioned you.
It’s obviously very easy to recognize things in those verses about
science, history, and government; but where’s the art? 

Consider this statement from 19th century scholar John Ruskin:
Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts,
the book of their deeds, the book of their words and the book of
their art. Not one of these books can be understood unless we read
the two others, but of the three the only trustworthy one is the
last.
This helps to explain a part of the issue—it allows us to explore “the
perplexities of nations,” but the need for us to study the arts goes
beyond this.
In an interview, President Gordon B.
Hinckley said that a study of the
humanities “gives an aspect of living
that is essential. You need technology.
You need the professions. You need all
of those things, but we need the heart
also, and the humanities speak to the
heart, men's aspirations for the good
and the beautiful” (LDS Church News,
19 March 2005).
Part of our core belief as Latter-day
Saints is found in the 13th Article of
Faith: “If there is anything virtuous,
lovely, or of good report or
praiseworthy, we seek after these
things.”
The study of the arts leads us to seek
after the virtuous, the lovely, and those
things that are of good report and praiseworthy. Good report from
whom? Praiseworthy- who praises it? These are important questions
that we ought to be able to answer as students and as Latter-day
Saints.
Marie Hafen, wife of Bruce Hafen, the former President of Ricks
College (now BYU-Idaho) and later a member of the First Quorum of
the Seventy, tells this story: 
“A friend I will call Marilyn is enjoying a far richer life today than
would have been the case if the world of books and beauty had not
opened her eyes and her mind. Marilyn grew up in a small town
where the most important things in her friends’ lives were being
popular and being seen with handsome, athletic guys. She dated a
young man who was a natural leader, but at the time he had no
serious aspirations for his life. Then Marilyn went with her family to
pick up her brother at the close of his mission.
“For the first time in her life, Marilyn opened her eyes to the size
and wonder and richness of the world: She visited great art
galleries and historic cathedrals; she saw the remnants of
aristocracy and the grimness of urban poverty; she sang hymns in
a foreign tongue; she saw mountains and oceans she never knew
existed.
“When she returned, her hometown was not the same. Looking at
everything with new eyes, she realized that she was far from ready
to make serious commitments to her immature boyfriend. From
that time on, her thirst for learning took her far beyond the days
when the city limits of her hometown had been the limits of her
aspirations.
“Now Marilyn’s continuing curiosity and broad vision of life
enhance her well-developed religious faith. Her life is more full, her
service to others is more
meaningful, and her children
share her insights—all because
she reached beyond the
boundaries of a teenage mind to
touch the broader boundaries of
an educated mind.” (Marie C.
Hafen, “Celebrating
Womanhood,” Ensign, June
1992)
This Foundations course is
designed to start you on much the
same path—to move you beyond
your present boundaries and open your mind, heart and spirit to the world of artistic creation.
Consider the following statements:
No one can feast his or her eyes on the art of Michelangelo and
not see the hand of God. Michelangelo himself knew it, as he
expressed in this statement: “The true work of art is but a shadow
of the divine perfection.” (M. Russell Ballard, “Filling the World with
Goodness and Truth,” Ensign, Jul 1996)
We seek that which is praiseworthy, lovely, virtuous, and of good
report, and we salute Beethoven, Shakespeare, Rembrandt, and
Michelangelo. (Ezra Taft Benson, “Jesus Christ—Gifts and
Expectations,” New Era, May 1975)
In the first place, some wise being organized my system, and
gave me my capacity, put into my heart and brain something that
delights, charms, and fills me with rapture at the sound of sweet
music. I did not put it there; it was some other being. As one of the
modern writers has said, “Music hath charms to soothe the savage
breast.” It has been proved that sweet music will actually tame the
most malicious and venomous beasts, even when they have been
stirred up to violent wrath, and make them docile and harmless as
lambs. Who gave the lower animals a love for those sweet sounds,
which with magic power fill the air with harmony, and cheer and
comfort the hearts of men, and so wonderfully affect the brute
creation? It was the Lord, our heavenly Father, who gave the
capacity to enjoy these sounds, and which we ought to do in His
name, and to His glory. But the greater portion of the sectarian
world consider it sacrilege to give way to any such pleasure as even
to listen to sweet music, much more to dance to its delightful
strains. This is another short sermon. (Brigham Young, Delivered in
the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, April 9, 1852)
I have in my home a reasonably good sound system. I do not use
it frequently, but now and again, I sit quietly in the semidarkness
and listen for an hour or so to music that has endured through the
centuries because of its remarkable qualities. I listened the other
evening to Beethoven’s Concerto for the Violin and marveled that
such a thing could come of the mind of a man. The composer, I
suppose, was very much like the rest of us. I do not know how tall he was or how broad he was or how much he weighed. I assume
that he got hungry, felt pain, and had most of the problems that we
all have, and maybe some that we do not have. But out of the
genius of that mind came a tremendous blending to create rare and
magnificent masterpieces of music. (Gordon B. Hinckley, “I
Believe,” Ensign, August 1992)
Who was this Michelangelo? Who was Beethoven? Rembrandt? How
can we enjoy music in the spirit that Brother Brigham meant? How
may I better seek after these things?
In our world we are bombarded with information, much of it in the
form of music and visual images. How can we sort through them?
What are these enduring “remarkable qualities” that President Hinckley
mentions?
In the 123rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants verse 12 we read:
For there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and
denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men,
whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the
truth because they know not where to find it—
While this verse directly applies to the teachings of the restored
Gospel, it also has a great deal of merit when considering the virtuous,
lovely, good report, and praiseworthy. We would have more of it in our
lives if we knew “where to find it.” This course is designed to help you
do several things. One of them is to help you be more able to “find it”
by exploring those enduring works that President Hinckley mentioned.
Another is to give you the tools to effectively analyze works art to
better enable you to fill your life with these things, to make your life
richer and more blessed.
Our approach to the exploration of the arts will begin with analysis
of various art forms in terms of their elements and organization. The
fact that some art forms are all around us doesn’t guarantee our
immediate (or perhaps even easily) understanding them. If I found
myself suddenly transported to Turkey I would not automatically be
fluent in speaking Turkish. There would be some words I might
recognize. I might be able to understand a little bit of conversation
from observing context (these people in the Mosque are probably worshipping), but the key to learning the language would be in
learning the vocabulary and the rules. Learning about the arts is a
similar process. We will explore the arts in terms of what they’re made
of—their medium, and their other elements. We’ll explore how works
of art are organized. After this we’ll look at various artworks in their
historical and stylistic context. The arts were not produced in a
vacuum. There were issues of time and place that had enormous
impact on how paintings and buildings looked or songs were sung. We
will start our exploration in the age known as the Renaissance and
continue forward to the dawn of the Modernism. Along the way we’ll
learn the characteristics of style, composition, and context that
explains how Western art has “endured through the centuries because
of its remarkable qualities.” (Hinckley)

Two Ways of Reacting to the Arts: The Heart and the Mind
As humans we are a bundle of contradictions. That’s why we
simultaneously want to get good grades but don’t want to study very
hard. We want to be married in the temple, but find ourselves
attracted to the “bad” boys or girls. We pray for purity and then watch
The Family Guy. We all have ideals that we ardently believe in but
don’t live up to, and often the ideals themselves are contradictory—we
want to have a successful career and be a model parent, all at the
same time.
Today we generally consider these internal contradictions to be
undesirable. But the ancient Greeks embraced them. Ancient Greece
was polytheistic, meaning that they believed in more than one god.
Instead of worshipping one God, as we do, who sets the standard for
our morals and behavior, the Greeks worshipped a host of gods and
goddesses, each of whom embodied different human characteristics.
For our purposes this is perhaps best illustrated in two different
religious cults that were both important in ancient Greek worship,
those of the gods Apollo and Dionysus. Worshipers of Apollo wrote and
performed poetry and music that was logical, balanced, orderly, and
clear. Apollonian music appealed more to the intellect than to the
emotions. Musicians sang hymns to Apollo and accompanied them on
the lyre, a plucked, stringed instrument like a small harp. It was ideal for meditative solitude, the perfect accompaniment to an afternoon of
careful and quiet reasoning.
In contrast, Dionysus was
the god of wine, and by
extension, the god of unbridled
emotion, of wild revelry.
Worshippers of Dionysus sang
and danced to music that was
loud and rhythmical; instead of
a single lyricist singing a quiet,
simple, meditative tune,
Dionysian festivals featured a
full chorus chanting all the
words together, dancing and
acting out the drama, all
accompanied by a noisy, nasal,
double-reed instrument called
the aulos—a not particularly
beautiful instrument, but one
that could be heard over the
din of the Dionysiacs. The ultimate form of worship for Dionysus was
the tragedy, a play that displayed men and women in the grip of
passion, singing and acting and dancing in a great communal
celebration of man’s humanity. Instead of reason, tragedy was all
about emotion—the emotions of the characters in the tragedy, and the
emotions the audience felt as they beheld it.
To this day we can still perceive this division in the art we look at,
the music we listen to, the books we read. Think for instance of the
music you play on Sunday versus the music you play on Saturday
night. One is quiet, meditative, and suited for worship. The other is
party music, good for stirring up emotions and expressing desires.
Which are you, an Apollonian or a Dionysiac? Most of us have some of
both in us, and find an appropriate time and level for each. But some
clearly prefer one over the other. You will find that as we look at the
history of the arts that some time periods tended to favor Apollonian
art, while others favored Dionysian.
While some art is very obviously aimed at the emotions and other
art is clearly more analytical, it is safe to say that both logical and
emotional elements exist in all works of art. Some works of art—a Bach Fugue for example—achieve their quality largely through
excellence in the structural details. Other works of art—like a Chopin
Nocturne—draw on more subtle emotional elements. Both kinds of art
feature structure. Both also carry emotional appeal, but in nearly
every work of art one aspect—either the logical or the emotional is
dominant. The greatest works—like the Bach Fugue and the Chopin
Nocturne—have the capacity to move both parts of us. Our pleasure is
enhanced by understanding both the emotional and intellectual
elements of the works we encounter.
_____________________________________________________
Considering Art Forms
In our exploration of the arts we’ll be focusing on several art forms:
painting, sculpture, music, theatre, architecture and cinema. Of course
there are other art forms as well, but these six will give us adequate
skills to analyze the others.
Certain art forms, like music or literature, could be considered time
art. These works of art don’t really occupy physical space as much as
they have a definite temporal beginning, middle and end. To fully
experience Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, one must begin with the four
note “da da da dum” melody of the first movement and then continue
on until the final chords of the fourth movement. To experience the
Book of Mormon we have to start with “I Nephi having been born of
goodly parents” and persist until Moroni’s farewell, days or weeks or
even months later. As a work of art moves along through time we
might consider if there are repeating patterns or how the highs and
lows of the work are spaced out over time.
Painting, sculpture, architecture can be considered space art. In
other words these works occupy physical space and are created and
experienced in a spatial order—top to bottom, back to front, and so on.
The issue of time isn’t as important to space art as it is time art. You’ll
notice that it’s hard to answer these questions about painting: Where
is the beginning? What is the middle? Where does it end? How long will
it take to experience the work? Statues exist in space more than in
time just as novels exist in time more than space.
There are some art forms that combine their existence in both time
and space. A play exists in physical space (a stage) and yet has a clearly delineated temporal beginning, middle, and end. Consider for
example the transformation that takes place when a work of art moves
from time to space. If you read William Shakespeare’s Macbeth (which
you will this semester), you have experienced the art in time. Consider
what happens when the play is staged or filmed. What kind of set is
created? How do the actors move? What is the physical distance
between Macbeth and the three witches? These elements allow us to
deepen our understanding of this work. Other forms that are combined
art include dance and cinema.
______________________________________________________
Art and Subject
Many works of art are created to represent or explore a specific
subject. Subject in art answers the question, “What is it about?”
Literature is an art form that nearly always has a subject. Paintings
and sculptures are mostly representations of subjects. Architecture is,
however, an art form that does not usually depict a subject.
Architecture is mostly functional. It is an art form based more on
“what for?” rather than “what is it about?” Music occupies an
interesting middle ground in the realm of subject. Some works of
music were composed with a specific subject in mind, like Handel’s
Messiah. Others, like Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, have no specific
subject, but derive their meaning purely from musical elements, such
as melody, harmony, and rhythm. Music with a subject is known as
program music. Music without a subject is called absolute music.
We can judge an art work with a subject by how well it depicts that
subject. But we will learn that the artist often holds other artistic
values higher than the accuracy of the representation. We should also
remember that the quality of the depiction is often more important
than the quality of the subject. There have been some truly awful
pieces of art based on love. There have been some marvelous works
based on suffering. But this leads us to another important
consideration in the arts, the relationship between art and nature. 

Art and Nature
Nature certainly is the
source of a vast number of art
subjects. But it is important for
us to stop and clearly ponder
the distinct differences
between art and nature. The
words of two French authors
can lead us to some very
productive thinking about art
and nature. Honoré Balzac
speaking of art said, “The
mission is not to copy nature,
but to express it.”
Think how a work of art isn’t
an exact copy of nature.
Michelangelo’s famous Moses
statue at first glance seems
very lifelike with its dramatic
musculature and wonderful
proportion, but at its heart it’s
very unnatural. Moses wasn’t
all one color- his hair, eyes, skin and robe were not all variations of
white. The light that people saw coming from his head (Exodus 34:
29-35) wasn’t two marble horns. Moses wasn’t stuck inside a niche
when he descended from Sinai either- he was capable of movement
and speech. If we want to be nit-picky we must admit that this statue
is NOT realistic. And yet, the reality of what Michelangelo is exploring
is profoundly accurate.
In this context one can more easily understand the words of author
André Gide: “I admit there is only one thing that is not natural: art.”
And yet so often we explain to others the reason we like a particular
painting or a movie or a piece of music is “because it’s so real.” Maybe
that’s not exactly what we mean. Perhaps we are saying that the work
of art has communicated something that relates deeply to our own
reality.

Pablo Picasso is reported to have said that, “art is the lie that tells
the truth.” Isn’t this paradoxical? When you looked at Michelangelo’s
Moses did you find yourself saying “he’s in really good shape for a man
of eighty”? Or did you think about a powerful prophet and leader?
Certainly that’s what Michelangelo intended. The spiritual power of
Moses can be in part revealed to us through the artificiality of the
sculpture.
The idea of artistic truth is closely tied to the “Ponder and Prove”
step of the BYUI Learning Model. It requires effort to reflect on the
truths in a work of art. Some are very obvious; others might be called
“hidden treasures.” The next time you see a movie, listen to some
music, read a poem, or look at a painting, take a moment and think
about the relationship between physical and artistic truth. What do the
arts tell us? How do they communicate with us?
Why should we “seek after these things”?
______________________________________________________
Getting Started
At this point, I’d like to mention three things that I’d like you to
begin to practice as we begin your search for beauty in the arts.
First, concentrate. If you are married, or if you have been dating
someone for a while, or even if you have a close friend, you know that
you sometimes have to work at a relationship. This work involves
spending time with that person, talking to them, listening to them,
getting to know their interests, hopes, dreams and desires. You may
have noticed that people who are close to you get frustrated if you
don’t pay enough attention to them—if you keep texting while they are
trying to have an intimate conversation, for example. They might even
get up and stomp out of the room if it goes too far. Beauty is no
different. If you don’t take the time and give her your full attention,
she will probably just go away and leave you alone with your
distracted little life. So when you go to a work of art to experience its
beauty, don’t try to multitask. It’s okay to listen to music while you do
dishes or run at the track, but don’t let that be the only way you listen
to it. Take the time to sit down alone and do nothing else but listen to
music. When you go to a concert, leave your cell phone, computer, or homework assignment at home. Sit there for as long as it takes, pay
rapt attention, and ponder in your heart the things that you hear. This
might take some practice at first. But I promise it will be worth it.
Second, I ask that you work to acquire a taste for depth. Not only do
our hectic, distracted lives encourage a shallow acquaintance with
things, they encourage us to make acquaintance only with shallow
things. There are deep things out there, things of eternal moment,
things that carry sufficient potency to change the course of your life.
But they are not easy. They do not yield their treasures at first glance.
They are like rich veins of precious minerals buried deep in the earth.
You can’t just walk around and pick them up off the ground. Generally
those things that are easy to get are worth just about what you pay
for them.
Finally, you need to use your imagination. Imagination is a creative
act critical for human progress. A scientist seeking to cure a disease
must be able to imagine a cure, something that will destroy the germs
responsible for the disease. A financier must be able to imagine what
will happen with her money if she invests it in a certain place. An
engineer needs to imagine the stresses that will be placed on the
edifice he is designing so that it doesn’t fail under any conceivable
condition. All of these activities have much in common with
Michelangelo, who famously said that he could see the statue he was
setting out to create inside a block of marble, and creation was the act
of chipping away all of the marble that didn’t belong to the statue.
Imagination is also critical to the appreciation of art. Art is the
communication from one imaginative person to another. Over two
centuries ago Mozart felt emotions and imagined them in sound. He
then crafted symphonies, concertos, and operas to express those
images. When we listen to one of his concertos, we too must use our
imagination and try to imagine what emotions he had in mind. As we
do, we will begin to feel some of the same emotions. But just as
Mozart undoubtedly did not capture the exact emotions that he set out
to portray, and as his concept grappled with his material as he created
something new, so will each of us receive a different message, each
according to our needs and abilities. Of course, there are techniques of
perceiving just as there are techniques of creating, and with both,
practice helps.
