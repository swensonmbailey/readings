What Is An Earthquake?
On April 18, 1906, the earth moved. Not only did the
ground shake on the day of the Great San Francisco earthquake,
but land on both sides of the San Andreas fault permanently
shifted. Precise measurements of the amount of motion led
scientists to discover why earthquakes happen. Fences across the
San Andreas fault ripped apart, and it was no longer clear who
owned the land nearby.
Surveyors went to mountain peaks to relocate the property
boundaries. While the fences showed that ground had moved
near the fault, the surveyors also discovered that much of
northern California had moved and distorted during the
earthquake. The movement followed a pattern with most of the
motion near the fault and less motion far away.
Elastic rebound
What Is An Earthquake? (continued)
At the time, nobody knew what caused earthquakes. The survey measurements led a scientist named H. F. Reid to propose
one possible explanation (in the Lawson Report). He hypothesized that strain built up in the earth’s crust like the
stretching of a rubber band.
At some point, the earth would have to snap, sending shockwaves through the earth in an earthquake. This process is
called the elastic rebound theory. The problem was that Reid didn’t know what caused the strain to build up. Scientists
continued to survey after the earthquake and saw that motion continued throughout California, providing an important
piece of evidence that the Earth’s tectonic plates are in constant motion. This plate motion is Reid’s missing cause of strain.
Two plates can get stuck together where they meet (at boundaries called faults), but forces deep
within the earth drag and pull the plates in different directions. Faults remain stuck together for
many years as the nearby crust deforms and stretches, but eventually the strain is too much and
the two plates shift suddenly in an earthquake.
Today, scientists monitor the buildup of strain near locked faults using satellite observations, and have discovered that the
pattern is much like Reid hypothesized 100 years ago.

Faults and Basic Terminology
Earthquakes are the result of relentless forces deep within the Earth that continuously stress the lithosphere and crust. The
energy from these forces is stored as strain (deformation or bending) in the rocks. When this energy is released suddenly, an
earthquake results. The area underground on the fault where the sudden rupture takes place is called
the focus or hypocenter of the earthquake. The point on the Earth's surface directly above the hypocenter is called
the epicenter of the earthquake.

Lake earthquake in 1959.

Faults and Basic Terminology
An aftershock is a quake in the same volume of crust as the main shock, often on the same fault. They occur when the
displaced rock stabilizes in its new position, and they relieve the last bits of stress.
Aftershocks diminish in both magnitude and frequency with time, as shown on the chart above. Some aftershocks have
occurred more than a year after the main shock.
The aftershock pattern of this moderate earthquake in Hawaii is typical – aftershocks die
out with time, and magnitudes decrease. (USGS)

Normal faults break the crust into horsts (uplifted blocks) and grabens (valleys). Extension of the crust has broken the
western United States into horsts and grabens across western Utah, all of Nevada, and west to the Sierra Nevada mountains,
which are also a horst. This region is known as the Basin and Range geological province.

This diagram shows the Teton Range horst and the Jackson Hole graben. The block of rock above a fault is called the
hanging wall, and the block of rock below the fault is called the footwall. Miners gave them these names because
they frequently tunneled along faults to find the valuable minerals deposited there by hot waters – one block hung over
their heads, and the other was under their feet. The Teton Range is the northeastern margin of the Basin and Range
province. To the east is the northern Rocky Mountains province (NPS)

Recognizing Active Faults
A fault is defined as a fracture in earth’s crust along which displacement has taken place. Most faults shown on maps have
not moved in a very long time, up to millions of years. Active faults, however, are defined as the ones that have had
displacement more recently and have potential to slip again. Faults are most often stuck tight, but at times they lurch
several feet in a great earthquake.
Living near faults is a fact of life for many, but how do you recognize an active fault?
Some faults creep, which means they move very slowly all the time. Structures like bridges, sidewalks, and buildings built
astride these faults will be offset as the faults slowly move (up to a half inch each year). You can find these faults by looking
for bent or offset curbs and sidewalks in cities like Hollister, California (see the photo at top right). Not every offset curb is a
fault, but if you find several features that all line up, you may have found a fault.
This sidewalk is
offset by over one
foot due to creep on
the Calaveras Fault.
The arrows show
the direction of
movement.
BYUI
Recognizing Active Faults
Most faults don’t creep, however, so geologists look for the effects faults have on the landscape. Natural features like
streams, valleys, and ridges can be offset from repeated earthquakes if they cross the fault (Photo 2). Active faults also make
their own landscape features.
If one side of the fault moves up or down, it creates a long, straight step called a “scarp.”
As faults move along in repeated earthquakes, the rock along the fault is broken and ground down. This shattered zone is
more easily eroded than the surrounding rocks, so long valleys can form along the fault (Photo 3).
So faults can cause both ridges and valleys to form. Faults also can disrupt the movement of underground water, forcing it to
the surface to form springs and ponds. You’ve seen all of these features when you took the Google Earth tour of the San
Andreas in a previous week. A lot of these features are easiest to spot from the air. Our newest tool to find faults is Laser
Imaging Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), which uses laser light from an airplane to make a detailed image of the ground
surface that can even see through trees in a forest. Being able to read the landscape allows us to pinpoint the exact location
of dangerous faults.
The stream in this photo is offset by displacement along
the San Andreas Fault. As the fault continues to move,
the two parts of the stream will get farther apart. A
straight step, or scarp runs along the fault.

Seismic Wave Video
Every earthquake generates a suite of seismic
waves. The waves generated at the hypocenter
are primary or p-waves, and secondary or swaves. P-waves are compressional waves, like
sound waves. S-waves are shear waves, and
travel about a third slower than p-waves – hence
they are “secondary,” or the second to arrive at a
seismometer.
When p- and s-waves reach the earth’s surface,
some of their energy is converted into surface
waves, which include Rayleigh and Love waves
(see the diagram and video). Surface waves
travel slower than s-waves, and have higher
amplitudes, especially in soft soils. Surface waves
do most of the damage in earthquakes, and are
the memorable ones most people describe after a
quake.

How Earthquakes Cause Damage
Earthquakes cause damage in several ways that are discussed in the following sections:
• Shaking
• Fire
• Liquefaction
• Tsunami
• Seiche
• Landslides
Mexico City
Mexico City sustained heavy damage from
an earthquake in 1985 (University of California).
A different set of these occurs in each earthquake depending on magnitude, depth, location, types of building construction,
and local geology. We learn best about the causes of damage through case studies, which each illustrate the different
conditions that can lead to damage in different ways.
Shaking
The factors that affect the intensity of shaking are:
1) Magnitude. Larger magnitude earthquakes release more energy into the ground, which causes seismic waves
with higher energy and higher amplitudes (= harder shaking).
2) Distance. Shaking decays with distance. The same goes for depth – deeper earthquakes are essentially farther
away, and do less damage.
3) Local soils. Soft soils amplify shaking. The most severe shaking occurs in “fill,” where bays or marshy areas
have been filled in for construction purposes. Solid bedrock shakes considerably less (sometimes more than 15X
less!) than soft soils.
Soft Soils Animation
At greater distances, intensity is also affected by the
overall composition of the crust (see the map
below). Most of the western U.S., for example, is
highly faulted and made of heterogeneous materials.
Seismic waves lose energy every time they cross a
boundary into a different material, so in the West
seismic waves lose energy before they can travel very
far.
In the Midwest and East, however, the crust is more
uniform, and seismic waves travel longer distances
before losing energy. Earthquakes like those in New
Madrid, Missouri, in 1811-1812 resulted in more
widespread Mercalli intensities across the region
compared to the 1992 Landers quake of the same
magnitude.
Soft Soil Map
This map shows soft soil areas (including bay fill
in gray) in the San Francisco Bay Area. These
areas are most vulnerable to hard shaking and
liquefaction in an earthquake.
Shaking
The south end of the San Francisco bay is known as
“Silicon valley,” and several important technology
companies are located on soft soils, including
Google, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, Facebook., and
many others.
A large earthquake here could have widespread
consequences for the internet.
Fire
Fire did most of the damage in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Some fires were arson, but most started from oil
lamps, wood stoves, and chimney fires (USGS). The fires in San Francisco in 1906 spread unchecked because
liquefaction had severed the underground water pipes. Fire has also been a major factor in the Lisbon, Portugal
quake in 1755 and the Kobe, Japan earthquake in 1995.
San Francisco, 1906
Mitigating fires today involves homeowners more than most disaster mitigation measures because homes are so
numerous, and experience shows that many fires start in homes. Mitigating earthquake-caused fires involves proper
and careful installation and examination of gas-powered appliances and their supporting piping.
San Francisco, 1906 (USGS)
Mitigating Fires
Gas or propane water heaters and forced-air heaters must be strapped to the
structure of the house (not just to sheetrock) to prevent them from falling over
and breaking the gas lines. Broken gas lines are the most common cause of house
fires after earthquakes. Other gas appliances must be connected with adequate
flexible piping, which is also a building code requirement. Fireplaces, space
heaters, wood stoves, and other potential sources of fire must be used in
accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines, regularly inspected for problems,
and operated with care and common sense. It is also a good idea to have fire
extinguishers in your home.
After an earthquake, check around your building carefully. If you smell gas, you should immediately turn off the gas
valve that leads into your building. Wait for clearance from the gas company, and they will inspect appliances and
turn the gas back on for you.
Tsunami
 (source: NOAA, modified)
A tsunami (plural is also “tsunami” or “tsunamis”) is a set of ocean waves caused by any large, abrupt disturbance of
the sea, typically an upward or downward displacement of the seafloor, or a landslide. If the disturbance is close to
the coastline, local tsunamis can demolish coastal communities within minutes. A very large disturbance can cause
local devastation AND export tsunami destruction thousands of miles away. The word tsunami is a Japanese word,
represented by two characters: tsu, meaning, "harbor", and nami meaning, "wave".
Tsunamis are difficult to
illustrate because they
travel entirely under
water, with only tiny
disturbance of the
surface.
The ocean surface does
not rise up with seafloor
displacement – have you
ever tried to lift water?
Tsunamis are pulses of
dense water, like the
pulse you feel in the
water when someone
swims by you.

Animation of a Tsunami
Tsunami damage in Indonesia, 2004 (USGS).
Tsunami
Tsunami rank high on the scale of natural disasters.
Since 1850 alone, tsunami have been responsible for the loss of over 420,000 lives and billions of
dollars of damage to coastal structures and habitats.
Most of these casualties were caused by local tsunamis that occur about once per year somewhere in the world. For
example, the December 26, 2004, tsunami killed about 130,000 people close to the earthquake and about 58,000
people on distant shores. Predicting when and where the next tsunami will strike is currently impossible before the
tsunami starts. Once the tsunami is generated, forecasting tsunami arrival and impact is possible through modeling
and measurement technologies.
Tsunami (continued)
Tsunami are most commonly generated by earthquakes in marine and coastal regions. Major tsunami are produced
by large (greater than 7 on the Richer scale), shallow focus (< 30km depth in the earth) earthquakes associated with
the movement of oceanic and continental plates. They frequently occur in the Pacific, which is surrounded by
convergent plate boundaries.
When a plate boundary fault ruptures, it provides a vertical movement of the seafloor that allows a quick and efficient
transfer of energy from the solid earth to the ocean (try the animation in Figure 1). When a powerful earthquake
(magnitude 9.1) struck the coastal region of Indonesia in 2004, the movement of the seafloor produced a tsunami in
excess of 30 meters (100 feet) along the adjacent coastline, killing more than 240,000 people. From this source, the
tsunami radiated outward and within 2 hours had claimed 58,000 lives in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India.
Tsunami Marks
Tsunami damage in Indonesia, 2004 as seen from a satellite. The waves rushed up
hillsides as far as 100 feet locally, destroying buildings, farms, and forests. (NASA)
Underwater Landslides
Underwater landslides associated with smaller earthquakes are also capable of generating destructive tsunami. The
tsunami that devastated the northwestern coast of Papua New Guinea on July 17, 1998, was generated by an
earthquake that registered 7.0 on the Richter scale that apparently triggered a large underwater landslide. Three
waves measuring more than 7 meter high struck a 10-kilometer stretch of coastline within ten minutes of the
earthquake and landslide. Three coastal villages were swept completely clean by the waves, leaving nothing but sand
and 2,200 people dead.
Explosive Volcanoes and Asteroid Impacts
Other large-scale disturbances of the sea that can generate tsunami are explosive volcanoes and asteroid
impacts. The eruption of the volcano Krakatoa in the East Indies on Aug. 27, 1883 produced a 30-meter tsunami
that killed over 36,000 people. In 1997, scientists discovered evidence of a 4km diameter asteroid that landed
offshore of Chile approximately 2 million years ago that produced a huge tsunami that swept over portions of South
America and Antarctica.

Pressure Wave
Any vertical movement of the seafloor immediately sends a pressure wave (very like a p-wave) out in all directions.
The resulting tsunami propagates as a set of waves with great wavelengths (~100 km). The waves are unseen as they
travel across the deep ocean basins, and only become visible when they encounter shallow water (<100’s m deep).
In shallow water, the pulses slow down and pile up higher. At the coast, an arriving tsunami is like a rapidly rising
tide, and less commonly looks like big breakers. In some places, the first part of the tsunami wave train may be a low,
causing the sea to retreat. The wave heights and directions determined by the adjacent coastline geometry. Because
each fault displacement is unique, every tsunami has unique wavelengths, wave heights, and directionality. From a
tsunami warning perspective, this makes the problem of forecasting tsunamis in real time daunting.
Propagation of the December 26, 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean
Warning Systems
Since 1946, the tsunami warning system has provided
warnings of potential tsunami danger in the pacific
basin by monitoring earthquake activity and the
passage of tsunami waves at tide gauges. However,
neither seismometers nor coastal tide gauges provide
data that allow accurate prediction of the impact of a
tsunami at a particular coastal location.
Monitoring earthquakes gives a good estimate of the
potential for tsunami generation, based on
earthquake size and location, but gives no direct
information about the tsunami itself. Tide gauges in
harbors provide direct measurements of the tsunami,
but the tsunami is significantly altered by local
bathymetry and harbor shapes, which severely limits
their use in forecasting tsunami impact at other
locations.
Partly because of these data limitations, 15 of 20
tsunami warnings issued since 1946 were considered
false alarms because the tsunami that arrived was too
weak to cause damage.
Deep Ocean Tsunami Detection
Japan Tsunami, 2011
Tsunami coming over the protection wall in northern Japan, March 11, 2011. The
walls were not built tall enough to mitigate damage from this large of a wave. In
addition, locally the ground dropped more than a meter, effectively lowering the
tsunami walls. (L.A. Times)
Tsunami (continued)
Forecasting impacts
Recently developed real-time, deep ocean tsunami detectors (image right) will provide the data necessary to make
tsunami forecasts.
The November 17, 2003, Rat Is. tsunami in Alaska provided the most comprehensive test for the forecast
methodology.

1) The Mw 7.8 earthquake occurred on the shelf near Rat Islands, Alaska.
2) It generated a tsunami that was detected by three tsunameters located along the Aleutian Trench-the first
tsunami detection by the newly developed real-time tsunameter system.
3) These real-time data combined with the model database were then used to produce the real-time model tsunami
forecast.
For the first time, tsunami model predictions were obtained during the tsunami propagation, before
the waves had reached many coastlines.
The initial offshore forecast was obtained immediately after preliminary earthquake parameters (location and
magnitude Ms = 7.5) became available from the West Coast/Alaska TWC (about 15-20 minutes after the earthquake).
The model estimates provided expected tsunami time series at tsunameter locations. When the closest tsunameter
recorded the first tsunami wave, about 80 minutes after the tsunami, the model predictions were compared with the
deep-ocean data and the updated forecast was adjusted immediately..
Forecasting impacts
These offshore model scenarios were then used as input for the forecast for Hilo Bay. The tsunami recorded nearly
half a meter (peak-to-trough) signal at the Hilo gage. Model forecast predictions for this tide gage are compared with
observed data in the figure below. The comparison demonstrates that amplitudes, arrival time and periods of several
first waves of the tsunami wave train were correctly forecasted. More tests are required to ensure that the inundation
forecast will work for every likely tsunami. When implemented, such forecasts will be obtained even faster and would

Mitigation
The recent development of real-time deep ocean tsunami detectors and tsunami inundation models has given coastal
communities the tools they need to reduce the impact of future tsunamis. If these tools are used in conjunction with a
continuing educational program at the community level, at least 25% of the tsunami related deaths might be averted.
The best mitigation tools are education, zoning (to keep people and structures high above sea level wherever possible),
evacuation plans, tsunami walls, and warning systems.
Seiche
A seiche is a wave in a lake caused by displacement of the lake
bottom. In 1959, Hebgen Lake near West Yellowstone, Montana,
dropped nearly 6 meters on the side near the Hebgen Lake
normal fault in a M7.3 earthquake. The resulting seiche
damaged roads and lakeshore cabins, permanently changed the
shoreline, and went over the Hebgen dam several times (see
photos).

Liquefaction (source: Utah Geological Survey)
What is liquefaction?
Liquefaction may occur when water-saturated sandy soils are subjected to earthquake ground shaking. When soil
liquefies, it loses strength and behaves as a viscous liquid (like quicksand) rather than as a solid. This can cause
buildings to sink into the ground or tilt, empty buried tanks to rise to the ground surface, slope failures, nearly level
ground to shift laterally tens of feet (lateral spreading), surface subsidence, ground cracking, and sand blows.

earthquake near San Francisco, California. (USGS)
Why is liquefaction a concern?
Liquefaction has caused significant property damage
in many earthquakes around the world, and is a major
hazard associated with earthquakes in Utah.
The 1934 Hansel Valley and 1962 Cache Valley
earthquakes caused liquefaction, and large prehistoric
lateral spreads exist at many locations along the
Wasatch Front. The valleys of the Wasatch Front are
especially vulnerable to liquefaction because of
susceptible soils, shallow ground water, and relatively
high probability of moderate to large earthquakes.

earthquake near San Francisco, California. (USGS)
Where is liquefaction likely to occur?
Two conditions must exist for liquefaction to occur: (1) the soil must be susceptible to liquefaction (loose, watersaturated, sandy soil, typically between 0 and 30 feet below the ground surface) and (2) ground shaking must be
strong enough to cause susceptible soils to liquefy. Northern, central, and southwestern Utah are the state's most
seismically active areas. Identifying soils susceptible to liquefaction in these areas involves knowledge of the local
geology and subsurface soil and water conditions. The most susceptible soils are generally along rivers, streams, and
lake shorelines, as well as in some ancient river and lake deposits.
How is liquefaction potential determined?
The liquefaction potential categories shown on this map depend on the probability of having an earthquake within a
100-year period that will be strong enough to cause liquefaction in those zones.
• High liquefaction potential means that there is a 50% probability of having an earthquake within a 100-year
period that will be strong enough to cause liquefaction.
• Moderate means that the probability is between
10% and 50%
• Low between 5 and 10%
• Very low less than 5%.
What can be done?
To determine the liquefaction potential and
likelihood of property damage at a site, a sitespecific geotechnical investigation by a qualified
professional is needed. If a hazard exists, various
hazard-reduction techniques are available, such as
soil improvement or special foundation design. The
cost of site investigations and/or mitigation
measures should be balanced with an acceptable
risk.
What can be done? (continued)
Liquefaction mitigation involves putting building foundations on deep pilings, and is quite expensive. (USGS)

Landslides
We will study the broader category of mass wasting and specific causes of landslides in a later
chapter. Landslides are very common in earthquakes, triggered when shaking causes loose or unstable ground to
move downhill. The Hebgen Lake earthquake in 1959 (not far north of BYU-Idaho) caused a massive avalanche that
killed dozens of sleeping campers and blocked the Madison River, forming Quake Lake (see image below, left).

Part 4
Earthquake Mitigation
Mitigating the effects of earthquakes involves careful zoning and planning, but the most visible mitigation is adapting to
the hazard via seismic engineering.
San Francisco Bay Area residents and visitors observe gigantic construction projects along their roads and bridges each day.
Many of these projects are “seismic retrofits.”
A retrofit is a change in design and construction so that there are improvements; seismic retrofit means
changes are made to a structure to reduce or eliminate loss of life and property during an earthquake.
We retrofit buildings and roads that were built using older techniques with designs that are less safe. Generally, it is cheaper
and less disruptive to retrofit before hand than try to repair a structure damaged by an earthquake.
Retrofitting Buildings
There are many ways a structure can be retrofitted, but
two main ideas are most common.
1) Make a building stronger.
Sometimes this is the best approach. Walls and
foundations are designed to support the weight of the
rest of the building pushing down on them. Earthquake
shaking, however, pushes buildings side-to-side—a
direction that they are not always designed to
withstand.
Shear walls and cross bracing (Pictures 1 and 2)
provide strength and stiffness to resist future
earthquakes. Shear walls can strengthen individual
houses the same way they do for large buildings.
2) Isolate it from the ground
This is another way to protect a building—a lot like
adding shock absorbers to its foundation. The ground
can move back and forth during shaking, but the
building stays still (Pictures 3 and 4).
Because each building has unique architecture and a
unique setting, there is a different retrofit solution
that's right in each case. Earthquake engineers are
people who come up with creative new ways to make
these buildings safer than ever before.

Earthquake Mitigation Retrofitting Buildings
From the National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering University of California, Berkeley:

Earthquake Engineering can be defined as the branch of engineering devoted to mitigating earthquake hazards.

The General Goals in Seismic-Resistant Design and Construction for structures other than response-critical
facilities (hospitals, police, fire, and communications, which are held to a higher standard) are as follows:
a. To prevent non-structural damage in frequent minor ground shaking
b. To prevent structural damage and minimize non-structural damage in occasional moderate ground shaking
c. To avoid collapse or serious damage in rare major ground shaking
Structural components are those parts that hold up the building. Generally, these include foundations, walls,
floors, and roofs.
Non-structural components are everything else – heating and cooling systems, plumbing, doors, windows,
awnings, false ceilings, partitions, etc.

Elements of Seismic Structural Design

1. Building, including superstructure and non-structural components, should be light and avoid unnecessary
masses.
2. Building and its superstructure should be simple, symmetric, and regular in plan and elevation to prevent
significant torsional forces, avoiding large height-width ratio and large plan area.
3. Building and its superstructure should have a uniform and continuous distribution of mass, stiffness, strength and
ductility, avoiding formation of soft stories (one level that is weaker than the others).
4. Superstructure should have relatively short spans and avoid use of long cantilevers (overhangs).
5. The non-structural components should either be well separated so that they will not interact with the rest of the
structure, or they should be integrated with the structure.
6. Superstructure should be designed so that it can deform in a predictable, orderly way.
7. Superstructure should be provided with balanced stiffness and strength between its members, connections and
supports.
8. The stiffness and strength of the entire building should be compatible with the stiffness and strength of the soil
foundation.
9. The whole substructure (foundation) and superstructure (frame) should be tied together so that they can work as
a unit.
10. During construction, quality of structural materials and workmanship must be controlled.
U.S. Earthquake Risk
As the map below shows, earthquakes in the United States are not just a west coast problem. Damaging earthquakes have
happened all across the country, including unexpected places like Missouri and South Carolina. But the risk for states like
Florida, Texas, and Minnesota is quite low. This particular map shows the risk from shaking, measured as horizontal
acceleration as a percentage of gravity (g). This kind of calculation depends heavily on the historical record, so that some
unexpected quakes could happen, though they are much less likely.
Because it is a major plate boundary, the west coast of the United States has high and widespread earthquake hazards, and
earthquakes are common.
The San Andreas fault
through California is the
best-known hazard, but the
Cascadia subduction zone off
the coast of Oregon and
Washington has the
potential to generate great
earthquakes and tsunamis.

Earthquake prediction is usually defined as the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of a future earthquake
within stated limits. Prediction would have to be reliable (few false alarms and few failures) and accurate (small ranges of
uncertainty in space, time, and magnitude) to justify the cost of response. Previous Perspectives in Science may have given a
favorable impression of prediction research, and the news media and some optimistic scientists encourage the belief that
earthquakes can be predicted. Recent research suggests to us that this belief is incorrect.
An earthquake results from sudden slip on a geological fault. Such fracture and failure problems are notoriously intractable.
The heterogeneous state of the Earth and the inaccessibility of the fault zone to direct measurement impose further
difficulties. Except during a brief period in the 1970s , the leading seismological authorities of each era have generally
concluded that earthquake prediction is not feasible. Richter, developer of the eponymous magnitude scale, commented as
follows in 1977: "Journalists and the general public rush to any suggestion of earthquake prediction like hogs toward a full
trough... [Prediction] provides a happy hunting ground for amateurs, cranks, and outright publicity-seeking fakers”. This
comment still holds true.
For large earthquakes to be predictable, they would have to be unusual events resulting from specific physical states.
However, the consensus of a recent meeting was that the Earth is in a state of self-organized criticality where any small
earthquake has some probability of cascading into a large event. This view is supported by the observation that the
distribution of earthquake size is invariant with respect to scale for all but the largest earthquakes. Such scale invariance is
ubiquitous in self-organized critical systems.
Whether any particular small earthquake grows into a large earthquake depends on a myriad of fine details of physical
conditions throughout a large volume, not just in the immediate vicinity of the fault. This highly sensitive nonlinear
dependence of earthquake rupture on unknown initial conditions severely limits predictability. The prediction of individual
large earthquakes would require the unlikely capability of knowing all of these details with great accuracy. Furthermore, no
quantitative theory for analyzing these data to issue predictions exists at present. Thus, the consensus of the meeting was
that individual earthquakes are probably inherently unpredictable.
Earthquakes Cannot Be Predicted (continued)
Empirical earthquake prediction would require the existence of observable and identifiable precursors that would allow
alarms to be issued with high reliability and accuracy. There are strong reasons to doubt that such precursors exist.
Thousands of observations of allegedly anomalous phenomena (seismological, geodetic, hydrological, geochemical,
electromagnetic, animal behavior, and so forth) have been claimed as earthquake precursors, but in general, the phenomena
were claimed as precursors only after the earthquakes occurred. The pattern of alleged precursors tends to vary greatly from
one earthquake to the next, and the alleged anomalies are frequently observed at only one point, rather than throughout the
epicentral region. There are no objective definitions of "anomalies," no quantitative physical mechanism links the alleged
precursors to earthquakes, statistical evidence for a correlation is lacking, and natural or artificial causes unrelated to
earthquakes have not been compellingly excluded. In other fields threshold signals have often been erroneously claimed as
important physical effects; most if not all "precursors" are probably misinterpreted as well. Unfortunately, each new claim
brings a new set of proposed conditions, so that hypothesis testing, which is what separates speculation from science, is
nearly impossible.
Chinese seismologists claimed that the 4 February 1975 Haicheng (magnitude = 7.3) earthquake was successfully predicted
and that "very few people were killed". However, an official publication in 1988 states there were 1328 deaths and 16,980
injured. This disparity casts doubt on claims for the Haicheng prediction. China's Cultural Revolution was still taking place
in 1975. An American delegation's report captures the remarkable atmosphere: "Earthquake prediction was not a minor
experiment.... Indeed, belief in earthquake prediction was made an element of ideological orthodoxy that distinguished the
true party liners from right wing deviationists."
The possibility that political pressures caused inaccuracies in claims for the Haicheng prediction cannot be excluded. An
intense swarm of microearthquakes, many of which were large enough to be felt by local residents, began over 24 hours
before the main shock. These microearthquakes might well have induced some spontaneous evacuation. At least 240,000
people died in the 1976 Tangshan, China, earthquake, which was not predicted.
Varotsos and co-workers claim to be able to predict earthquakes in Greece on the basis of geoelectrical observations, but our
analyses show their claims to be without merit. Some of the geoelectrical signals are artifacts of industrial origin, and there is
no compelling evidence linking any of the geoelectrical signals to earthquakes. Controversy lingers primarily because
Varotsos's claims have not been stated as unambiguous and objectively testable hypotheses.
Is prediction inherently impossible or just fiendishly difficult? In practice, it doesn't matter. Scientifically, the question can
be addressed using a Bayesian approach. Each failed attempt at prediction lowers the a priori probability for the next
attempt. The current probability of successful prediction is extremely low, as the obvious ideas have been tried and rejected
for over 100 years. Systematically observing subtle phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and testing them thoroughly
against future earthquakes would require immense effort over many decades, with no guarantee of success. It thus seems
unwise to invest heavily in monitoring possible precursors.
Seismology can, however, contribute to earthquake hazard mitigation. Statistical estimates of the seismicity expected in a
general region on a time scale of 30 to 100 years [as opposed to "long-term predictions" of specific earthquakes on particular
faults within a few years] and statistical estimates of the expected strong ground motion are important data for designing
earthquake-resistant structures. Rapid determination of source parameters (such as location and magnitude) can facilitate
relief efforts after large earthquakes. Warnings of tsunamis produced by earthquakes also contribute significantly to public
safety. These are areas where earthquake research can greatly benefit the public.

earthquake in July, 1976. Death toll estimates are as high as 655,000. (whoi.edu)
