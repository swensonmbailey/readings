Although the importance of anthropomorphic conceptions in rabbinic
thought is widely recognized, their original nature and significance are
still in need of clarification.! A major difficulty in this task stems from
the scarcity and the obScurity of some of the most important texts,
which, moreover, cannot be dated with any precision.

The purpose of this article is to call attention to some early Chris
tian and Gnostic texts which bear upon Jewish conceptions of the
Divine Body or of the Hypostasis, or both, and might shed new light on
the origin and evolution of these conceptions. I wish to enmphasize that
in the present state of research, only tentative conclusions can be
reached, and that there will be no attempt here to deal with all sides of

the problem.
