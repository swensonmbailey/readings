The Living
Prophet:
The
President of
the Church

Introduction
 the President of the Church presides over
all priesthood quorums and the general
membership of the Church. President James e.
Faust (1920–2007) of the First Presidency
explained:	“He	is	the	senior	Apostle	on	the	
earth. He has been ordained and set apart as
the prophet, seer, and revelator to the world.
He has been sustained as the President of the
Church. He is the presiding high priest over all
the priesthood on the earth. He alone holds and
exercises	all	the	keys	of	the	kingdom	under	the	
lord Jesus Christ, who is the head of this Church
and is the chief cornerstone” (“Continuing
Revelation,” Ensign, aug. 1996, 5).
 elder Mark e. Petersen (1900–1984) of the
Quorum of the twelve apostles testifi ed that
the living prophet is the lord’s spokesman to
the Church and to the world: “People who are
not members of this church may not sense the
great signifi cance attached to his ministry. even
some latter-day Saints have not yet discovered
it. But the president of the Church is in fact
a prophet raised up in these last days to give
inspired guidance, not only to latter-day Saints,
but to all mankind everywhere” (in Conference
Report, apr. 1972, 15; or Ensign, July
1972, 40).
 a careful study of this chapter will
deepen your appreciation for the
President of the Church and the
priesthood keys of authority he
holds and will help you understand
how safety comes to those who
choose to heed his counsel.
Commentary
 The Living Prophet Possesses All the
Keys of the Priesthood
	•	 	President	Boyd		K.	Packer	of	the	Quorum	
of the Twelve Apostles told of an
experience when President Spencer W.
Kimball (1895–1985) declared that he, as
the President of the Church, held the keys
of the priesthood:
 “In 1976 following a conference
in Copenhagen, Denmark, President
Spencer W. Kimball invited us to a small
church to see the statues of Christ and the
Twelve Apostles by Bertel Thorvaldsen.
The Christus stands in an alcove beyond
the altar. Standing in order along the sides
of the chapel are the statues of the Twelve,
with Paul replacing Judas Iscariot.
 “President Kimball told the elderly
caretaker that at the very time Thorvaldsen
was creating those beautiful statues in
Denmark, a restoration of the gospel of
Jesus Christ was taking place
in America with apostles and
prophets receiving authority
from those who held it
anciently.
 “Gathering those present
closer to him, he said to
the caretaker, ‘We are living
Apostles of the Lord Jesus
Christ,’ and pointing to Elder
Pinegar he said, ‘Here is a
Seventy like those spoken of in
the New Testament.’
 “We were standing near the statue of
Peter, whom the sculptor depicted holding
keys in his hand, symbolic of the keys of
the kingdom. President Kimball said, ‘We
hold the real keys, as Peter did, and we use
them every day.’
 “Then came an experience I will never
forget. President Kimball, this gentle
prophet, turned to President Johan H.
Benthin, of the Copenhagen Stake, and
in a commanding voice said, ‘I want you
to tell every prelate [religious leader] in Denmark that they do not hold the keys!
I hold the keys!  ’
 “There came to me that witness
known to Latter-day Saints but diffi cult to
describe to one who has not experienced
it—a light, a power coursing through
one’s very soul—and I knew that, in very
fact, here stood the living prophet who
held the keys” (in Conference Report,
Apr. 1995, 7; or Ensign, May 1995, 8).
	•		The	prophet	has	the	powers,	gifts,	and	
blessings that enable him to offi ciate in
any offi ce of the Church (see D&C 46:29 ;
 107:91–92 ). Elder Bruce R. McConkie
(1915–85) of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles identifi ed responsibilities of
the President of the Church, the living
prophet:
 “He is the earthly head of the kingdom
of God, the supreme offi cer of the
Church, the ‘President of the High
Priesthood of the Church; Or,
in other words, the Presiding
High Priest over the High
Priesthood of the Church.’
( D. & C. 107:65–66 .) His
duty is ‘to preside over
the whole church. . . . ’
( D. & C. 107:91 .)
 “He is the one man on earth at a
time who can both hold and exercise
the keys of the kingdom in their fulness.
( D. & C. 132:7 .) By the authority vested
in him, all ordinances of the gospel are
performed, all teaching of the truths of
salvation is authorized, and through the
keys which he holds, salvation itself
is made available to men of his day ”
( Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed. [1966], 591–92;
emphasis added).
	•	 	President	Gordon		B.	Hinckley	(1910–
2008) explained how the priesthood
keys continue from the Prophet Joseph
Smith to the current living prophet in
this dispensation: “That same authority
which Joseph held, those same keys and
powers which were the very essence
of his divinely given right to preside,
were by him conferred upon the Twelve
Apostles with Brigham Young at their
head. Every president of the Church
since then has come to that most high
and sacred offi ce out of the Council of
the Twelve. Each of these men has been
blessed with the spirit and power of
revelation from on high. There has been
an unbroken chain from Joseph Smith,
Jr., to Spencer W. Kimball [who was the
current prophet]. Of that I bear solemn
witness and testimony before you this
day. This Church is built upon the sure
word of prophecy and revelation—built,
as Paul wrote to the Ephesians, ‘upon
the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Jesus Christ himself being
the chief corner stone.’ ( Eph. 2:20 .)” (in
Conference Report, Apr. 1981, 27–28; or
 Ensign, May 1981, 22).
 The Prophet Is the Lord’s
Spokesman
	•		President	Harold		B.	Lee	(1899–1973)	
indicated that the Saints need
never be deceived, for the Lord
has established an unmistakable
channel of instruction: “ When
there is to be anything different from that which the Lord has told us
already, he will give it to his prophet
not to some Tom, Dick, or Harry that is
thumbing his way across the country as
we have had people tell the story; and not
through someone, as another story relates,
who swooned and came up and gave a
revelation. I have said, ‘Do you suppose
that when the Lord has his prophet on
the earth, that he is going to take some
round-about means of revealing things
to his children? That is what he has a
prophet for, and when he has something
to give to this Church, he will give it to
the President, and the President will see
that the presidents of stakes and missions
get it, along with the General Authorities;
and they in turn will see that the people
are advised of any new change’” (“The
Place of the Living Prophet, Seer, and
Revelator” [address to CES religious
educators, July 8, 1964], 11; emphasis
added).
•	 President Ezra Taft Benson (1899–1994)
taught that we should value the words
of the prophet more than those of any
other person: “Of all mortal men, we
should keep our eyes most firmly fixed
on the captain, the prophet, seer, and
revelator, and president of The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This
is the man who stands closest to the
fountain of living waters. There are some
heavenly instructions for us that we can
only receive through the prophet. A good
way to measure your standing with the
Lord is to see how you feel about, and act
upon, the inspired words of his earthly
representative, the prophet-president.
The inspired words of the president are
not to be trifled with. All men are entitled
to inspiration, and various men are
entitled to revelation for their particular
assignment. But only one man stands
as the Lord’s spokesman to the Church
and the world, and he is the president
of the Church. The words of all other
men should be weighed against his
inspired words” (“Jesus Christ—Gifts and
Expectations,” New Era, May 1975, 16).
The Lord Leads the Church by
Continuous Revelation to His Prophet
•	 The Lord reveals His mind and will to His
prophet. President Spencer W. Kimball
testified that the heavens are still open
and that the Lord guides His Church from
day to day:
“I bear witness to the world today that
more than a century and a half ago the
iron ceiling was shattered; the heavens
were once again opened, and since that
time revelations have been continuous. . . .
“Since that momentous day in 1820,
additional scripture has continued to
come, including the numerous and vital
revelations flowing in a never-ending
stream from God to his prophets on the
earth. . . .
“. . . We testify to the world that
revelation continues and that the vaults
and files of the Church contain these
revelations which come month to month
and day to day. We testify also that there
is, since 1830 when The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized,
and will continue to be, so long as time
shall last, a prophet, recognized of God
and his people, who will continue to
interpret the mind and will of the Lord.
“Now, a word of warning: Let us
not make the error of the ancients. Numerous modern
sectarians believe in
the Abrahams, the
Moseses, and the Pauls,
but resist believing in
today’s prophets. The ancients also could
accept the prophets of an earlier day, but
denounced and cursed the ones who were
their contemporaries.
“In our day, as in times past, many
people expect that if there be revelation
it will come with awe-inspiring,
earth-shaking display. For many it is hard
to accept as revelation those numerous
ones in Moses’ time, in Joseph’s time, and
in our own year—those revelations which
come to prophets as deep, unassailable
impressions settling down on the
prophet’s mind and heart as dew from
heaven or as the dawn dissipates the
darkness of night.
“Expecting the spectacular, one may
not be fully alerted to the constant flow
of revealed communication. I say, in
the deepest of humility, but also by the power and force of a burning testimony
in my soul, that from the prophet of the
Restoration to the prophet of our own year,
the communication line is unbroken, the
authority is continuous, a light, brilliant
and penetrating, continues to shine.
The sound of the voice of the Lord is a
continuous melody and a thunderous
appeal. For nearly a century and a half
there has been no interruption” (in
Conference Report, Apr. 1977, 114–15; or
Ensign, May 1977, 77–78; emphasis added).
The Word of the Lord to the
Living Prophet Is Timely and of
Utmost Importance to Us Now
•	 The world is constantly changing. New and
different problems and many variations of
old problems continually challenge us. Our
wise and loving Heavenly
Father knows all things
before they happen, and
He reveals answers and
solutions through His
prophet as needed. In
addition to interpreting
and reaffirming existing
scripture, a prophet acts
as the agent through
whom the Lord can give new scripture,
according to the needs of the people.
Speaking under the direction of the Holy
Ghost, the living prophet’s words take
precedence over other statements on
the same issue. His inspired counsel is
in harmony with the eternal truths in the
standard works and is focused upon the
needs and conditions of his day.
Doctrines are eternal and do not
change; however, the Lord, through
His prophet, may change practices and
programs, according to the needs of the
people. The following examples illustrate
this principle:
1. The law of Moses was given to the
children of Israel as a “schoolmaster
to bring [them] unto Christ”
(Galatians 3:24; see also Galatians
3:24, footnote b; from Joseph Smith Translation) but was fulfilled when the
law of the gospel was given by Jesus
Christ (see Galatians 3:23–25; Mosiah
13:27–35; 3 Nephi 9:15–20).
2. When Jesus was upon the earth, the
gospel was generally taught only
to the house of Israel (see Matthew
10:5–6; 15:24; Mark 7:25–27). After His
Resurrection, the Savior commanded
the Apostles to take the gospel to
everyone (see Mark 16:15; Acts 10).
3. In Moses’s time the Melchizedek
Priesthood was taken from the general
population of Israel and the Aaronic
Priesthood was given only to the
Levites (see D&C 84:24–26; see also
Numbers 8:10–22; Hebrews 7:5). In the
time of Christ and His Apostles, the
Melchizedek Priesthood was again made
available and the Aaronic Priesthood
was offered to men who were not
Levites (see Luke 6:13–16; Philippians
1:1; Hebrews 7:11–12). Today “every
faithful, worthy man in the Church may
receive the holy priesthood, with power
to exercise its divine authority” (Official
Declaration 2).
•	 President John Taylor (1808–87) referred to
prophets in the Old Testament to illustrate
that new revelations are necessary for
new generations: “We require a living
tree—a living fountain—living intelligence,
proceeding from the living priesthood in
heaven, through the living priesthood on
the earth. . . . And from the time that Adam
first received a communication from God,
to the time that John, on the Isle of Patmos,
received his communication, or Joseph
Smith had the heavens opened to him, it
always required new revelations, adapted
to the peculiar circumstances in which the
churches or individuals were placed. Adam’s
revelation did not instruct Noah to build
his ark; nor did Noah’s revelation tell Lot
to forsake Sodom; nor did either of these
speak of the departure of the children of
Israel from Egypt. These all had revelations
for themselves, and so had Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, Jesus, Peter, Paul, John, and Joseph.
And so must we” (The Gospel Kingdom,
sel. G. Homer Durham [1987], 34; see also
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: John
Taylor [2001], 158).
•	 President Wilford Woodruff (1807–98) spoke
of a meeting attended by the Prophet Joseph
Smith and Brigham Young:
“Brother Joseph turned to
Brother Brigham Young and
said, ‘Brother Brigham I
want you to take the stand
and tell us your views with
regard to the written oracles
and the written word of
God.’ Brother Brigham took the stand, and
he took the Bible, and laid it down; he took
the Book of Mormon, and laid it down; and
he took the Book of Doctrine and
Covenants, and laid it down before him, and
he said: ‘There is the written word of God to
us, concerning the work of God from the
beginning of the world, almost, to our day.’
‘And now,’ said he, ‘when compared with
the living oracles [living prophets] those
books are nothing to me; those books do
not convey the word of God direct to us
now, as do the words of a Prophet or a man
bearing the Holy Priesthood in our day and
generation. I would rather have the living
oracles than all the writing in the
books.’ That was the course he pursued.
When he was through, Brother Joseph said
to the congregation: ‘Brother Brigham has
told you the word of the Lord, and he has
told you the truth’” (in Conference Report,
Oct. 1897, 22–23; emphasis added).
•	 President Boyd K. Packer taught that
principles and doctrines of the gospel
remain constant, even though Church
practices must be adjusted occasionally:
“Procedures, programs, the administrative
policies, even some matters of organization
are subject to change. We are quite
free, indeed, quite obliged to alter them
from time to time. But the principles, the
doctrines, never change” (“Principles,”
Ensign, Mar. 1985, 8).
The Lord Will Never Permit the Living
Prophet to Lead the Church Astray
•	 President Wilford Woodruff declared
that we can have full confidence in the
direction the prophet is leading the
Church: “The Lord will never permit
me or any other man who stands as
President of this Church to lead you
astray. It is not in the programme. It is not
in the mind of God. If I were to attempt
that, the Lord would remove me out of
my place, and so He will any other man
who attempts to lead the children of
men astray from the oracles of God and
from their duty” (Official Declaration 1,
“Excerpts from Three Addresses by
President Wilford Woodruff Regarding the
Manifesto”; emphasis added).
•	 President Harold B. Lee taught this
same principle: “You keep your eye upon
him whom the Lord called, and I say to
you now, knowing that I stand in this
position, you don’t need to worry about
the President of the Church ever leading
people astray, because the Lord would
remove him out of his place before He
would ever allow that to happen” (The
Teachings of Harold B. Lee, ed. Clyde J.
Williams [1996], 533).
•	 President Gordon B. Hinckley gave
similar assurance to Church members:
“The Church is true. Those who lead it
have only one desire, and that is to do the
will of the Lord. They seek his direction
in all things. There is not a decision of
significance affecting the Church and its
people that is made without prayerful
consideration, going to the fount of
all wisdom for direction. Follow the
leadership of the Church. God will
not let his work be led astray” (in
Conference Report, Oct. 1983, 68–69; or
Ensign, Nov. 1983, 46; emphasis added).
Some People Will Believe in
Past Prophets but Reject the Living
Prophets
•	Many people revere the prophets of the
past but refuse to accept the prophet
the Lord has sent to guide them in their
day (see Helaman 13:24–26). President
Harold B. Lee shared an experience that
illustrates this tendency:
“I have a banker friend in New York.
Years ago when I met him in company
with President Jacobson, who was then
presiding over the Eastern States Mission,
we had quite a discussion. President
Jacobson had given him a copy of the
Book of Mormon, which he had read, and
he spoke very glowingly of what he called
its ‘tremendous philosophies.’ Near the
close of the business hour he invited us to
ride to the mission home in his limousine,
and we accepted. On the way, as he
talked about the Book of Mormon and his
reverence for its teachings, I said, ‘Well,
why don’t you do something about it? If
you accept the Book of Mormon, what
is holding you back? Why don’t you join the Church? Why don’t you accept Joseph
Smith, then, as a prophet?’
“And he said, very thoughtfully and
carefully, ‘Well, I suppose the whole
reason is that Joseph Smith is too close
to me. If he had lived two thousand
years ago, I suppose I would believe. But
because he is so close, I guess that is the
reason I can’t accept him as a prophet.’
“Here was a young man saying, ‘I
believe in the dead prophets that lived a
thousand-plus years ago, but I have great
difficulty believing in a living prophet.’
That attitude is also taken toward God.
To say that the heavens are sealed and
there is no revelation today is saying
that we do not believe in a living Christ
today, or a living God today—we believe
in one long-since dead and gone. So this
term living prophet has real significance”
(“The Place of the Living Prophet, Seer,
and Revelator,” in Charge to Religious
Educators, 2nd ed. [1982], 105).
•	 Claiming a belief in dead prophets while
rejecting the living prophet is a very old
problem. Some of the Pharisees of Jesus
Christ’s day rejected the living Christ but
accepted the prophet Moses, who had led
Israel over 1,000 years earlier. They reviled
a man whom Jesus had healed, saying:
“Thou art his disciple; but we are
Moses’ disciples.
“We know that God spake unto Moses:
as for this fellow [Jesus], we know not
from whence he is” (John 9:28–29; see also
Matthew 23:29–30, 34; Helaman 13:24–29).
•	 President Harold B. Lee taught that a
belief in revelation must include the
teachings of our current prophet:
“Soon after President David O. McKay
announced to the Church that
members of the First Council
of the Seventy were being
ordained high priests in order
to extend their usefulness
and to give them authority to
act when no other General
Authority could be present, a seventy I met
. . . was very much disturbed. He said to me,
‘Didn’t the Prophet Joseph Smith say that
this was contrary to the order of heaven to
name high priests as presidents of the First
Council of the Seventy?’ And I said, ‘Well,
I have understood that he did, but have
you ever thought that what was contrary
to the order of heaven in 1840 might
not be contrary to the order of heaven
in 1960?’ He had not thought of that. He
again was following a dead prophet, and
he was forgetting that there is a living
prophet today. Hence the importance of
our stressing that word living.
“Years ago as a young missionary I
visited Nauvoo and Carthage with my
mission president, and we were holding
a missionary meeting in the jail room
where Joseph and Hyrum had met their
deaths. The mission president related
the historical events that led up to the
martyrdom and then he closed with this
very significant statement: ‘When the
Prophet Joseph Smith was martyred, there
were many saints who died spiritually with
Joseph.’ So it was when Brigham Young died: so it was when John Taylor
died. . . . Some Church members
died spiritually with Wilford
Woodruff, with Lorenzo Snow,
with Joseph F. Smith, with Heber J.
Grant, with George Albert Smith.
We have some today willing to
believe someone who is dead
and gone and to accept his words
as having more authority than
the words of a living authority
today” 

Enrichment Material
Fourteen Fundamentals in
Following the Prophet
President Ezra Taft Benson, 1980
Devotional Speeches of the Year
(1981), 26–30; emphasis added.
My beloved brothers and
sisters, I am honored to be in
your presence today. You students
are a part of a choice young
generation—a generation which
might well witness the return of
our Lord.
Not only is the Church growing
in numbers today, it is growing
in faithfulness and, even more
important, our young generation,
as a group, is even more faithful
than the older generation. God
has reserved you for the eleventh
hour—the great and dreadful
day of the Lord. It will be your
responsibility not only to help
bear off the kingdom of God
triumphantly but to save your
own soul and strive to save those
of your family and to honor
the principles of our inspired
constitution.
To help you pass the crucial
tests which lie ahead I am going
to give you today several facets
of a grand key which, if you will
honor them, will crown you with
God’s glory and bring you out
victorious in spite of Satan’s fury.
Soon we will be honoring our
prophet [Spencer W. Kimball]
on his eighty-fifth birthday.
As a Church we sing the song,
“We Thank Thee, O God, For a
Prophet.” Here then is the grand
key—follow the prophet—and
here now are fourteen
fundamentals in following
the prophet, the President of
The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.
First: The prophet is the only
man who speaks for the Lord in
everything.
In section 132, verse 7, of the
Doctrine and Covenants the
Lord speaks of the Prophet—the
President—and says: “There is
never but one on the earth at a
time on whom this power and
the keys of this priesthood are
conferred.”
Then in section 21, verses 4–6,
the Lord states:
“Wherefore, meaning the
church, thou shalt give heed unto
all his words and commandments
which he shall give unto you as
he receiveth them, walking in all
holiness before me; “For his word ye shall receive,
as if from mine own mouth, in all
patience and faith.
“For by doing these things
the gates of hell shall not prevail
against you.”
Did you hear what the Lord said
about the words of the prophet?
We are to “give heed unto all his
words”—as if from the Lord’s
“own mouth.”
Second: The living prophet
is more vital to us than the
standard works.
President Wilford Woodruff
tells of an interesting incident
that occurred in the days of the
Prophet Joseph Smith:
“I will refer to a certain meeting
I attended in the town of Kirtland
in my early days. At that meeting
some remarks were made that
have been made here today,
with regard to the living oracles
and with regard to the written
word of God. The same principle
was presented, although not as
extensively as it has been here,
when a leading man in the Church
got up and talked upon the
subject, and said: ‘You have got
the word of God before you here
in the Bible, Book of Mormon,
and Doctrine and Covenants; you
have the written word of God, and
you who give revelations should
give revelations according to those
books, as what is written in those
books is the word of God. We
should confine ourselves to them.’
“When he concluded, Brother
Joseph turned to Brother Brigham
Young and said, ‘Brother Brigham,
I want you to take the stand and
tell us your views with regard to
the living oracles and the written
word of God.’ Brother Brigham
took the stand, and he took the
Bible, and laid it down; he took
the Book of Mormon, and laid
it down; and he took the Book
of Doctrine and Covenants, and
laid it down before him, and he
said: ‘There is the written word of
God to us, concerning the work
of God from the beginning of the
world, almost, to our day. And
now,’ said he, ‘when compared
with the living oracles those
books are nothing to me; those
books do not convey the word
of God direct to us now, as do
the words of a Prophet or a man
bearing the Holy Priesthood in
our day and generation. I would
rather have the living oracles than
all the writing in the books.’ That
was the course he pursued. When
he was through, Brother Joseph
said to the congregation: ‘Brother
Brigham has told you the word of
the Lord, and he has told you the
truth.’” [In Conference Report,
October 1897, pp. 22–23]
Third: The living prophet is more
important to us than a dead
prophet.
The living prophet has the power
of TNT. By that I mean “Today’s
News Today.” God’s revelations to
Adam did not instruct Noah how
to build the ark. Noah needed his
own revelation. Therefore, the
most important prophet, so far as
you and I are concerned, is the one
living in our day and age to whom
the Lord is currently revealing His
will for us. Therefore, the most
important reading we can do is
any of the words of the prophet
contained . . . each month in our
Church magazines. Our marching
orders for each six months are
found in the general conference
addresses, which are printed in the
Ensign magazine.
I am so grateful that the
current conference report is
studied as part of one of your
religion classes—the course
entitled “Teachings of the Living
Prophets,” number 333. May I
commend that class to you and
suggest that you get a copy of the
class manual at your bookstore
whether you’re able to take the
class or not. . . .
Beware of those who would
pit the dead prophets against
the living prophets, for the living
prophets always take precedence.
Fourth: The prophet will never
lead the Church astray.
President Wilford Woodruff
stated: “I say to Israel, The Lord
will never permit me or any other
man who stands as president of
the Church to lead you astray. It
is not in the program. It is not in
the mind of God.” (The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, selected by
G. Homer Durham [Salt Lake
City: Bookcraft, 1946], pp. 212–
213.)
President Marion G. Romney
tells of this incident which
happened to him:
“I remember years ago when
I was a Bishop I had President
[Heber J.] Grant talk to our ward.
After the meeting I drove him
home. . . . Standing by me, he put
his arm over my shoulder and
said: ‘My boy, you always keep
your eye on the President of the
Church, and if he ever tells you to
do anything, and it is wrong, and
you do it, the Lord will bless you
for it.’ Then with a twinkle in his
eye, he said, ‘But you don’t need
to worry. The Lord will never let
his mouthpiece lead the people
astray.’ [In Conference Report,
October 1960, p. 78]
Fifth: The prophet is not required
to have any particular earthly
training or credentials to speak
on any subject or act on any
matter at any time.
Sometimes there are those who
feel their earthly knowledge on
a certain subject is superior to
the heavenly knowledge which
God gives to His prophet on
the same subject. They feel the
prophet must have the same
earthly credentials or training
which they have had before they
will accept anything the prophet
has to say that might contradict
their earthly schooling. How
much earthly schooling did
Joseph Smith have? Yet he gave
revelations on all kinds of subjects.
We haven’t yet had a prophet
who earned a doctorate in any
subject, but as someone said, “A
prophet may not have his Ph.D.
but he certainly has his LDS.”
We encourage earthly knowledge
in many areas, but remember, if
there is ever a conflict between
earthly knowledge and the words
of the prophet, you stand with the
prophet, and you’ll be blessed and
time will vindicate you.
Sixth: The prophet does not have
to say “Thus saith the Lord” to
give us scripture.
Sometimes there are those who
haggle over words. They might
say the prophet gave us counsel
but that we are not obligated
to follow it unless he says it is
a commandment. But the Lord
says of the Prophet Joseph, “Thou
shalt give heed unto all his words
and commandments which he shall
give unto you” (D&C 21:4; italics
added).
And speaking of taking counsel
from the prophet, in D&C 108:1,
the Lord states: “Verily thus saith
the Lord unto you, my servant
Lyman: Your sins are forgiven you,
because you have obeyed my voice
in coming up hither this morning
to receive counsel of him whom I
have appointed” (italics added).
Said Brigham Young, “I have
never yet preached a sermon and
sent it out to the children of men,
that they may not call scripture”
(Journal of Discourses, 26 vols.
[London: Latter-day Saints’ Book
Depot], 13:95).
Seventh: The prophet tells us
what we need to know, not
always what we want to know.
“Thou hast declared unto us
hard things, more than we are
able to bear,” complained Nephi’s
brethren. But Nephi answered
by saying, “The guilty taketh the
truth to be hard, for it cutteth
them to the very center” (1 Nephi
16:1, 3). Or, to put it in another
prophet’s words, “Hit pigeons
flutter.”
Said President Harold B. Lee:
“You may not like what comes
from the authority of the Church.
It may contradict your political
views. It may contradict your social
views. It may interfere with some
of your social life. . . . Your safety
and ours depends upon whether
or not we follow. . . . Let’s keep
our eye on the President of the
Church.” [In Conference Report,
October 1970, p. 152–153]
But it is the living prophet who
really upsets the world. “Even
in the Church,” said President
Kimball, “many are prone
to garnish the sepulchres of
yesterday’s prophets and mentally
stone the living ones” (Instructor,
95:257).
Why? Because the living
prophet gets at what we need to
know now, and the world prefers
that prophets either be dead or
mind their own business. Some
so-called experts of political
science want the prophet to keep
still on politics. Some would-be
authorities on evolution want the
prophet to keep still on evolution.
And so the list goes on and on.
How we respond to the words
of a living prophet when he tells
us what we need to know, but
would rather not hear, is a test of
our faithfulness.
Said President Marion G.
Romney, “It is an easy thing to
believe in the dead prophets.”
And then he gives this
illustration:
“One day when President Grant
was living, I sat in my office across
the street following a general
conference. A man came over to
see me, an elderly man. He was
very upset about what had been
said in this conference by some of
the Brethren, including myself. I
could tell from his speech that he
came from a foreign land. After
I had quieted him enough so he
would listen, I said, ‘Why did you
come to America?’ ‘I am here
because a prophet of God told me
to come.’ ‘Who was the prophet,’
I continued. ‘Wilford Woodruff.’
‘Do you believe Wilford Woodruff
was a prophet of God?’ ‘Yes, I do.’
‘Do you believe that President
Joseph F. Smith was a prophet of
God?’ ‘Yes, sir.’
“Then came the sixty-four
dollar question. ‘Do you believe
that Heber J. Grant is a prophet
of God?’ His answer, ‘I think he
ought to keep his mouth shut
about old age assistance.’
“Now I tell you that a man
in his position is on the way to
apostasy. He is forfeiting his
chances for eternal life. So is
everyone who cannot follow
the living Prophet of God.” [In
Conference Report, April 1953,
p. 125]
Eighth: The prophet is not
limited by men’s reasoning.
There will be times when you
will have to choose between
the revelations of God and the
reasoning of men—between
the prophet and the politician
or professor. Said the Prophet
Joseph Smith, “Whatever God
requires is right, no matter what
it is, although we may not see the
reason thereof until long after the
events transpire” (Scrapbook of
Mormon Literature, vol. 2, p. 173).
Would it seem reasonable to
an eye doctor to be told to heal a
blind man by spitting in the dirt,
making clay, and applying it to the
man’s eyes and then telling him
to wash in a contaminated pool?
Yet this is precisely the course
that Jesus took with one man,
and he was healed. (See John
9:6–7.) Does it seem reasonable
to cure leprosy by telling a man to
wash seven times in a particular
river? Yet this is precisely what
the prophet Elisha told a leper
to do, and he was healed. (See
2 Kings 5.)
“For my thoughts are not your
thoughts, neither are your ways
my ways, saith the Lord. For as the
heavens are higher than the earth,
so are my ways higher than your
ways, and my thoughts than your
thoughts.” [Isaiah 55:8, 9]
Ninth: The prophet can
receive revelation on any
matter—temporal or spiritual.
Said Brigham Young:
“Some of the leading men in
Kirtland were much opposed to
Joseph the Prophet, meddling
with temporal affairs. . . .
“In a public meeting of the
Saints, I said, ‘Ye Elders of Israel,
. . . will some of you draw the
line of demarcation, between
the spiritual and temporal in the
Kingdom of God, so that I may
understand it?’ Not one of them
could do it. . . .
“I defy any man on earth to
point out the path a Prophet of
God should walk in, or point
out his duty, and just how far he
must go, in dictating temporal
or spiritual things. Temporal and
spiritual things are inseparably
connected, and ever will be.”
Tenth: The prophet may be
involved in civic matters.
When a people are righteous
they want the best to lead them
in government. Alma was the
head of the Church and of the
government in the Book of
Mormon, Joseph Smith was mayor
of Nauvoo, and Brigham Young
was governor of Utah. Isaiah
was deeply involved in giving
counsel on political matters and
of his words the Lord Himself
said, “Great are the words of
Isaiah” (3 Nephi 23:1). Those who
would remove prophets from
politics would take God out of
government.
Eleventh: The two groups who
have the greatest difficulty in
following the prophet are the
proud who are learned and the
proud who are rich.
The learned may feel the
prophet is only inspired when
he agrees with them; otherwise,
the prophet is just giving his
opinion—speaking as a man. The
rich may feel they have no need to
take counsel of a lowly prophet.
In the Book of Mormon we read:
“O that cunning plan of the
evil one! O the vainness, and
the frailties, and the foolishness
of men! When they are learned
they think they are wise, and
they hearken not unto the
counsel of God, for they set it
aside, supposing they know of
themselves, wherefore, their
wisdom is foolishness and it
profiteth them not. And they shall
perish.
“But to be learned is good if they
hearken unto the counsels of God.
“And whoso knocketh, to him
will he open; and the wise, and
the learned, and they that are rich,
who are puffed up because of
their learning, and their wisdom,
and their riches—yea, they are
they whom he despiseth; and
save they shall cast these things
away, and consider themselves
fools before God, and come down
in the depths of humility, he will
not open unto them.” [2 Nephi
9:28, 29, 42; italics added]
Twelfth: The prophet will not
necessarily be popular with the
world or the worldly.
As a prophet reveals the truth
it divides the people. The honest
in heart heed his words, but the
unrighteous either ignore the
prophet or fight him. When the
prophet points out the sins of the
world, the worldly either want to
close the mouth of the prophet,
or else act as if the prophet didn’t
exist, rather than repent of their
sins. Popularity is never a test
of truth. Many a prophet has
been killed or cast out. As we
come closer to the Lord’s second
coming, you can expect that as the
people of the world become more
wicked, the prophet will be less
popular with them.
Thirteenth: The prophet and his
counselors make up the First
Presidency—the highest quorum
in the Church.
In the Doctrine and Covenants,
the Lord refers to the First
Presidency as “the highest council
of the Church” (107:80) and says,
“whosoever receiveth me, receiveth
those, the First Presidency, whom I
have sent” (112:20).
Fourteenth: The prophet and the
presidency—the living prophet
and the First Presidency—follow
them and be blessed; reject them
and suffer.
President Harold B. Lee relates
this incident from Church history:
“The story is told in the early days
of the Church—particularly, I think,
at Kirtland—where some of the
leading brethren in the presiding
councils of the Church met secretly
and tried to scheme as to how
they could get rid of the Prophet
Joseph’s leadership. They made the
mistake of inviting Brigham Young
to one of these secret meetings.
He rebuked them, after he had
heard the purpose of their meeting.
This is part of what he said: ‘You
cannot destroy the appointment of
a prophet of God, but you can cut
the thread that binds you to the
prophet of God and sink yourselves
to hell.’” [In Conference Report,
April 1963, p. 81]
In a general conference of the
Church President N. Eldon Tanner
stated: “The Prophet spoke out clearly
on Friday morning, telling us what
our responsibilities are. . . .
“A man said to me after that,
‘You know, there are people in our
state who believe in following the
Prophet in everything they think
is right, but when it is something
they think isn’t right, and it doesn’t
appeal to them, then that’s different.’
He said, ‘Then they become their
own prophet. They decide what
the Lord wants and what the Lord
doesn’t want.’
“I thought how true, and how
serious when we begin to choose
which of the covenants, which of
the commandments we will keep
and follow. When we decide that
there are some of them that we
will not keep or follow, we are
taking the law of the Lord into
our own hands and become our
own prophets, and believe me,
we will be led astray, because we
are false prophets to ourselves when
we do not follow the Prophet of God.
No, we should never discriminate
between these commandments,
as to those we should and should
not keep.” [In Conference Report,
October 1966, p. 98; italics added]
“Look to the Presidency and
receive instruction,” said the
Prophet Joseph Smith (Teachings
of the Prophet Joseph Smith,
selected by Joseph Fielding Smith
[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co.,
1938], p. 161). But Almon Babbitt
didn’t, and in the Doctrine and
Covenants section 124, verse 84,
the Lord states: “And with my
servant Almon Babbitt, there are
many things with which I am not
pleased; behold, he aspireth to
establish his counsel instead of the
counsel which I have ordained,
even that of the Presidency of my
Church.”
In conclusion, let us summarize
this grand key, these “Fourteen
Fundamentals in Following the
Prophet,” for our salvation hangs
on them.
First: The prophet is the only
man who speaks for the Lord in
everything.
Second: The living prophet is
more vital to us than the standard
works.
Third: The living prophet is
more important to us than a dead
prophet.
Fourth: The prophet will never
lead the Church astray.
Fifth: The prophet is not
required to have any particular
earthly training or credentials to
speak on any subject or act on any
matter at any time.
Sixth: The prophet does not
have to say “Thus saith the Lord”
to give us scripture.
Seventh: The prophet tells us
what we need to know, not always
what we want to know.
Eighth: The prophet is not
limited by men’s reasoning.
Ninth: The prophet can receive
revelation on any matter, temporal
or spiritual.
Tenth: The prophet may be
involved in civic matters.
Eleventh: The two groups who
have the greatest difficulty in
following the prophet are the
proud who are learned and the
proud who are rich.
Twelfth: The prophet will not
necessarily be popular with the
world or the worldly.
Thirteenth: The prophet and
his counselors make up the First
Presidency—the highest quorum
in the Church.
Fourteenth: The prophet and the
presidency—the living prophet
and the First Presidency—follow
them and be blessed; reject them
and suffer.
I testify that these fourteen
fundamentals in following the
living prophet are true. If we
want to know how well we stand
with the Lord, then let us ask
ourselves how well we stand with
His mortal captain. How closely
do our lives harmonize with the
words of the Lord’s anointed—the
living prophet, the President of the
Church, and with the Quorum of
the First Presidency?
May God bless us all to look to
the prophet and the presidency in
the critical and crucial days ahead
is my prayer. In the name of Jesus
Christ. Amen.
