Argument #1  - Argument from
Direct and Circumstantial Evidence

Direct Evidence (Observation)

A. At least 14 informal witnesses claim
that he/she felt plates weighing
between 40-60 pounds, lifted the plates
or were shown plates by angels.

B. Many non-converts and non-friends
tried to steal or bargain for the plates.

C. Martin Harris half-century long
testimony of the angel and plates is
reliable. (from MH proposition)

D. Oliver Cowdery's testimony of the
angel and plates, as well as receipt of
divine authority in 3 separate visions
are reliable (from OC proposition)

E. David Whitmer's testimony of the
angel and plates is reliable (from DW
proposition)

F. Eight men testified of seeing, lifting,
and inspecting the plates and their
testimonies are reliable (FW
proposition)

G. There is no direct evidence against
the proposed fact that Joseph
possessed plates of ancient design and
received divine authority

Circumstantial Evidence From
Purported Books of Scripture
(Inference)

H. Direct evidence (witnesses) and
circumstantial evidence (Original and
Printer's manuscripts) corroborate
Joseph's Book of Mormon origin story.

I. Critical theories of Book of Mormon
origins lack evidence and contradict
each other in why, how, and who.

J. Evidence is strong for a literal
equivalence translation of Book of
Mormon names and at least fifteen
nonbiblical Book of Mormon names are
now attested in ancient Hebrew
inscriptions, fourteen of which date to
before 587 B.C.  None of these were
known or published in Joseph Smith’s
day.  The Book of Mormon also
contains 4 authentic Egyptian names.

No naturalistic explanation can
reasonably account for these
correspondences.

K.  The beginning of the Book of
Mormon is consistent with the culture
and situation in Jerusalem in about 600
B.C. It fits in the context in at least the
following:

Migration from Northern Kingdom of
Lehi's ancestors and "land of
inheritance" separate from home in
Jerusalem
Egyptian influence/writing during
time of peak Egyptian influence
Lehi as one of many documented
prophets sent to Jerusalem
Unbelief that Jerusalem could be
destroyed
Lehi preaching against some of
Josiah's "reforms"
Lehi preaching against the removal
of Original Temple tradition teaching
atoning Messiah
Nephi understanding the "tree" as
"woman" due to Asherah worship
Tree of Life as ancient Wisdom
symbolism, intact and almost
certainly as it was in 600 BC
Lehi’s vision has the iron rod guiding
people to the great tree—the older
and probably the original
understanding of the word
Complaints of corruption and removal
of scripture ("plain and precious
things")
Melchizedek priesthood extant in 600
bc
Lehi as a fleeing prophet
No naturalistic explanation can
reasonably account for these
correspondences.

L. The part of the Book of Mormon
covering the Lehite exodus in Arabia is
consistent in geography and culture in
at least the following:

The three recorded occasions of Lehi
offering sacrifices, when measured
against sacrificial law in the Bible,
become immediately understandable
in light of the family’s situation.
“The Frankincense Trail,” from
Dhofar, the ancient source of that
precious material, to near Jerusalem;
the trail conforms in detail to Joseph
Smith’s account of distances, turns,
and specific geography.
Maintenance and workings of bows
and arrows
Nahom as a name and a date and a
place and a turn in the ancient
frankincense trail and a specific
relationship to another location -
bountiful
Affliction in the empty quarter
Bountiful in Arabia matching all
required elements (ore, mountain,
cliffs, fruit, honey, timber, etc.)
No naturalistic explanation can
reasonably account for these
correspondences.

M. The Book of Mormon's description of
geography and topography corresponds
to an actual geography and topography
in Mesoamerica including

geological conditions required for
events recorded in 3rd Nephi
metals and gems
over 600 other mutually dependent
correspondences
No naturalistic explanation can
reasonably account for these
correspondences.

N. The Book of Mormon's description of
populations, literacy, and culture
corresponds with Mesoamerican
chronology and culture in at least the
following

Jaredites and Olmec overlap in time
depth and geography in an area
north of the proposed Nephite lands
Nephites and the Maya overlap in
time depth and geography
Both Olmec and Maya were literate
cultures
The remnants of the Olmec culture
surviving and overlapping for the
appropriate centuries with the
Nephite cultures
Desire to elevate Nephi to king
reflects cultural trends discerned for
Mesoamerican peoples during that
timeframe
Jacob's sermon discussing the twin
evils of costly apparel and polygamy
fits into the economic pressures that
were beginning during that time
period in that region
The movement of Quichean speakers
into Kaminaljuyu corresponds in time
depth to the change in circumstances
that lead to Mosiah fleeing the city of
Nephi
The merger of Nephites and the
people of Zarahemla corresponds in
time and place with the linguistic
movement of Zoque speakers into
the Grijalva River Valley
King Benjamin's denials correspond
with mayan kingship.
They system of over-kingship and
interstate visits corresponds with
Mesoamerican political systems
The treatment of captives
The Anti-Nephi-Lehies and the cult of
war
The expedition Limhi sent to find
Zarahemla that gets lost following
the wrong river and finds remains
The use of cement and treeless in
the Teotihuacan area north of
Nephite lands
The historical influence of the
powerful city-state of Teotihuacan
provides the explanatory background
for the changes that Mormon notes
in nature of warfare and destruction
of Nephites
No naturalistic explanation can
reasonably account for these
correspondences.

O. Despite the fact that Joseph Smith
lived in the age of Modern, or technical
warfare, the Book of Mormon
consistently reflects the basic patterns
of Pre-Modern warfare as well as
ancient Mesoamerican warfare in the
following. The Pre-Modern and
Mesoamerican military patterns
described in the Book of Mormon are
not limited to generalities, but also
extend to the minutest details of the
text.

the causes of warfare;
agricultural economic base;
the problems of supplying soldiers in
times of war;
seasonal patterns in warfare;
military implications of geography
and climate;
limited use of animal resources;
armor;
weapons technology and typology;
fortifications.
No naturalistic explanation can
reasonably account for these
correspondences.

P. After publishing the Book of
Mormon, Joseph Smith claimed to
reveal a part of the prophecy of Enoch.
In at least the following 22 themes and
specifics Joseph Smith's Enoch
corresponds to Enochic literature not
available to the world in 1830:

Enoch as "lad"
Enoch's call occurring while on a
journey
Open your mouth
Divine protection
Turning of rivers
Gibborim = giants
Wars, Bloodshed
Secret Oaths
The "wild man"
Mahijah name
Mahijah role
Enoch's homeland righteous
Book of Remembrance
Great fear in listeners
Conceived in sin
Hope
War
"Wild beasts roar"
Prison for unrepentant
Weeping Enoch
God weeping
Enoch initiated
No naturalistic explanation can account
for these correspondences. Therefore,
it is reasonable (probable?) that Joseph
Smith received revelation from a non-
earthly source, God, as he claimed.
(the Enoch Proposition)

Q.  In 1842, Joseph Smith published
portions of a "Book of Abraham." In at
least the following, the Book of
Abraham's unique and unknown-
in-1842-information about Abraham is
corroborated by ancient texts:

The very existence of a record
written by Abraham (the Bible
provides no hint that a Book of
Abraham ever existed);
Abraham's obvious literacy, and his
possession of ancient records (Abr.
1:28)
Abraham's desire to be one who
"possesses great knowledge" (Abr.
1:1);
The rebellion of his fathers, who
had once received the priesthood
but turned to idol worship,
according to Egyptian practices
(Abr. 1:4-10);
The practice of human sacrifice,
including the sacrifice of children, as
part of the practice of local idolaters
in Chaldea (Abr. 1:7-11);
The killing of people who refused to
worship idols of wood or stone (Abr.
1:11);
The violent seizing of Abraham by
the local priest to slay Abraham also
as a human sacrifice (Abr. 1:12;
Facs. 1);
The role of Terah, Abraham's father,
in seeking to have Abraham killed
(Abr. 1:30);
The miraculous delivery of Abraham
from death by the power of God,
who sent an angel to free Abraham
after Abraham cried to the Lord
(Abr. 1:15; 2:13);
The repentance of Terah,
Abraham's father, and his
subsequent return to idolatry after
the famine abated (Abr. 1:30; 2:5);
Abraham's knowledge of stars,
planets, and astronomy obtained
through revelation (Abr. 3:1-18);
Abraham teaching astronomy in
Egypt
Revelation to Abraham about the
premortal existence of spirits or
intelligences in the presence of God,
including information on a great
council in heaven where plans were
established for this earth and our
mortal trial here (Abr. 3:18-28).
Abraham honored by kings - or on a
throne
No naturalistic explanation can
reasonably account for these
correspondences.

R. In 1842 Joseph Smith introduced the
"endowment." He claimed this
endowment was ancient; specifically
that it was had by the ancient
patriarchs and by Jesus. Evidence
exists in ancient texts for at least the
following specific endowment themes
and discrete symbolic actions, images,
or phrases:

The tradition originates with Jesus.
(see section 5.ii)
The initiatory rituals are the center
of Christ’s gospel. (see section 5.iii)
Preexistence of mankind and
Creation Drama. (see section 5.iii)
Washing and anointing with oil. (see
section 5.iii)
Ritual prayer circles. (see section
5.iii)
Use of ritual clothing. (see section
5.iii)
Handclasps as tokens of recognition
and Hands in Cupping Shapes to
Receive.
Sacred Signs, Tokens and Keywords
including Knowledge of the sacred
name of God is necessary for
exaltation.
Sacred marriage to complete the
ordinance.
The initiation rituals symbolize a
heavenly ascent and veil separates
the initiate from God.
No naturalistic explanation can
reasonably account for these
correspondences.

S. Evidence from the Book of Mormon,
Book of Enoch, Book of Abraham and
the Endowment corroborating Joseph's
claims do not have a reasonable
naturalistic explanations. Therefore, it
is reasonable that Joseph received
these texts/information from a
supernatural source as he claimed.

If Joseph received these texts and
information from a supernatural source
as claimed, it is reasonable to believe
his claims regarding the existence and
origin of the metal plates.

Circumstantial Evidence From
Purported Revealed Doctrine
(Inference)

Joseph's revelations "solve" in many
respects centuries old philosophical and
Christian-specific problems; are
consistent with the earliest forms of
Christianity; provide guidance on the
abiding anxieties of life and in many
cases traditional theology is moving
closer to Joseph's theology. Specifically:

T.  Joseph Smith's theology dissolves
the question of nihilism and the threat
of non-being. (Part III)

U. Joseph Smith's theology resolves the
paradoxes of creation created by
Classical Theism.  (Part III)

V. Joseph Smith's theology of material
spirit and body requiring each other for
full self-hood resolves the mind-body
problem. (Part III)

W. Belief in divine embodiment did in
fact exist and persist among the faithful
followers of Christ from Christianity’s
earliest beginnings into the fifth century
AD. Joseph Smith's embodied God
restores the original Christian
understanding. (Part III)

X. Joseph Smith revealed a passible
and personal God that was drastically
different than the then-accepted God of
Christianity. More than a century later,
this view God has now been reaccepted
by virtually all of Christianity. (Part IV)

Y. It is the accepted view of virtually
every scholar who has reviewed the
evidence at length that the doctrine of
creatio ex nihilo is a philosophical
innovation at the end of the second
century A.D. Joseph Smith's revealed
theology of creation ex materia restores
the original Christian understanding of
creation. (Part IV)

Z. By denying creation ex nihilo, Joseph
Smith's theology obliterates the central
christological dispute. (Part IV)

AA. Joseph Smith revealed a Godhead
("social trinity") that was drastically
different than the then-accepted Trinity
of (Western) Christianity. This view of
the Trinity is the accepted pre-creedal
view and has now been accepted by
thinkers representing every major
Christian tradition.  (Part V)

BB.  Joseph Smith defined "perfect" as
unchanging in some respects (love,
miracles, sympathy) and eternally self-
surpassing in other respects (creation,
relationship-creating). This definition of
perfection and view of God was
radically different than the God (and
definition of perfection) of classical
theism.

However, in the 20th century
philosophers have argued that there is
"magnificent intellectual content - far
surpassing that of such systems as
Thomism - implicit in such a
conception. Thus, to many, Joseph's
definition of perfection is more
intellectually rigorous and has more
philosophical power than classical
theism.

CC.  Joseph Smith's theology speaks
directly to that need in may christians
for the development of the feminine
image of God. It places the divine
feminine on the same ontological
footing as Heavenly Father and
requires man and women for human
deification.

DD. Joseph Smith claimed to reveal a
doctrine of deification that was met
throughout the years with calls of
heresy, pantheism, and philosophical
unsoundness. However, in the past 60
years the early Christian doctrine of
deification has been re-accepted by
every branch of western christianity.

EE. Joseph Smith was heavily criticized
for rejecting a closed canon. However,
in the last 50 years scholars are
arguing that it is difficult biblically and
theologically to argue for a closed
canon.

FF. Joseph Smith's theology of
postmortem evangelization and
vicarious baptism dissolves the
soteriological problem of evil.

GG. As recorded by Joseph F. Smith,
D&C 138 represents a remarkably
condensed amalgamation of the three
versions of the Descent of Christ into
Hades.

HH. When Joseph Smith revealed
postmortem evangelization, no
Christian community accepted the
doctrine and it had laid dormant for
more than a thousand years. However,
it is now agreed upon that the earliest
Christians taught the idea and within
the last century, more and more biblical
commentators are affirming that Christ
did indeed preach the gospel to
disembodied spirits who had the choice
of accepting his message.

II. There is evidence (biblical and post-
biblical) that some of the earliest
christians practiced vicarious baptism
for the dead at least the early fifth
century.

JJ. Joseph Smith's theology dissolves
the logical problem of evil - the most
pervasive and powerful argument
against the existence of a loving God.
Joseph's theology allows a Christian to
trust and worship God in full confidence
that he is doing all that can be done,
given the nature of things, to help us
overcome evil as we progress in the
struggle with it.

KK. Joseph Smith's revelations provide
unique insight into the Atonement: (1)
Unlike in Classical Theism, God is not
the source of the alienation between
Man and God (2) The "problem" that
requires Jesus' sacrifice is  inherent
within each human soul and therefore
there is "no other way" (3) The
resolution of alienation requires our
response to Jesus' free act of love (4)
(at least one Mormon concept) of
Atonement is similar to the earliest
Moral Influence idea (and assuming
you don't believe in creation ex nihilo
prior to 200 AD, might be exactly the
same) with the important addition of
understanding why the atonement is
absolutely necessary. It is not
necessary because of some eternal
structure of justice in the universe
outside us which demands payment
from us for our sins, nor of some
similar structure within the nature of
God. The Atonement is absolutely
necessary because of the nature of
intelligences, a nature that is self-
existent, not the creation of God, and
therefore uniquely impervious to
metaphysical coercion.

No naturalistic explanation can account
for any person's ability to produce
these ideas. Further, no naturalistic
explanation can reasonably account for
someone of Joseph's time, place,
education and life-circumstances to
produce these ideas. Therefore, it is
reasonable that he received
"revelation" as claimed.

If Joseph received these texts and
information from a supernatural source
as claimed, it is reasonable to believe
his claims regarding the existence and
origin of the metal plates.

Therefore, it is reasonable (probable)
that Joseph Smith in fact possessed
plates weighing between 40-60 pounds
of which the Book of Mormon is a
functional translation as claimed.
