    Appendix 6: Propitiation, Expiation, and the
Intercessory Work of Christ in Latter-day Saint
Theology
In recent years, some Latter-day Saints have been attempting to empty the concept of
propitiation from atonement theology. Consider the following from Terryl and Fiona
Givens, The Christ Who Heals: How God Restored the Truth that Saves Us (Salt Lake City:
Deseret Book, 20017):79
One epithet attached to Christ that can mislead in unfortunate ways is that of
“mediator.” Warring nations may employ mediators. Contending spouses may
make use of mediators. And antagonistic strikers and management are often
assigned them . . . In the Christian West, with its emphasis on sin as rebellion
against God’s “rigid interdiction,” Christ’s role as mediator became that of our
shield and defender against the wrath and vengeance of a sovereign God . . .
Appeasing some abstract justice, or propitiating a sovereign God, is not the point.
(p. 53, 55, emphasis in original)
It was in precise anticipation of such weakness that our Savior was appointed,
before earth’s creation, to bear the burden of pain that follows in sin and error’s
wake. Christ assumes the full weight of the aftershocks of our actions in our
place (he “suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer”). (p. 55,
emphasis added)
Mediation . . . refers to Christ’s serving as an instrument by which a desired
purpose or harmony is achieved. And that is precisely what Christ does. He
brings out our soul’s healing, mending fractured relationships, resolving our
temporary alienation from our Heavenly Parents, and effecting a more whole and
holy self-hood. In this role, Christ is not protecting us from divine anger or
judgment. On the contrary, Christ is collaborating with our Heavenly Parents for
our homecoming. (p. 58)
Comfort, not judicial defense, is the purpose of a paraclete. Jesus promised a
comforter, not a legal counsel, to those apostles who would soon bear the gospel
to a hostile world, suffering trials, persecutions, and execution. Rather than a judicial advocate, they would need a helper, a sustainer, a teacher—someone to
comfort them in times of distress and danger. And that is what the Lord promises
them—the Holy Spirit as Comforter. (p. 59)

While rejecting (correctly) the Reformed doctrine of Penal Substitution,80 the authors
empty the propitiatory nature of Christ’s redemptive sacrifice and intercession.

Footnote:

80 During the October 12, 1883 meeting of the Salt Lake School of the Prophets, the following, relating to the
nature of Christ’s atonement, was discussed by John Taylor:
Prest. Taylor said: There is a great deal of carelessness regarding the taking of the Lords supper. People
should always remember Him and his atonement then they do so. It was instituted that He might be
brought to the remembrance of His Saints. The tokens, sacrifices, etc., of the ancient church were
emblematical of the atonement; it is the one thing running through the whole of the Scriptures. Men
offered up the blood of animals, doves, etc. God offered up his own son. (Salt Lake School of the
Prophets, 1867-1883 [ed. Devery S. Anderson; Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2018], 526, emphasis
added)
What is important about this statement is that this serves as a refutation of the common (though false) concept of
penal substitution, wherein God the Father has to get his pound of flesh and imputes the guilt and sin (at least of
the elect) to the body of Christ and Jesus acts as their penal substitute. Instead, God offered up Christ as a selfish
act, giving up His beloved Son to be our advocate, similar to how the worshippers in Old Testament times gave
up something that, for them personally (not necessarily “in the eyes of the law”), had great value (namely,
animals such as sheep and doves).

While rejecting (correctly) the Reformed doctrine of Penal Substitution,80 the authors
empty the propitiatory nature of Christ’s redemptive sacrifice and intercession. Note the
following:
(1) The Propitiatory Nature of Christ's Sacrifice
In some Protestant circles, there is a debate as to the meaning of the terms ιλασμος and
ιλαστηριον in the New Testament as well as the Hebrew כפר .For some commentators,
most notably C.H. Dodd in his book, The Bible and the Greeks, such terms mean only
expiation. Such would fit with the forensic nature of atonement and justification held by
Protestantism, wherein an offender/sinner has their trespasses covered over, but there
is no intrinsic change within the person at justification (such belonging only to
sanctification). Dodd’s thesis was critiqued from various angles from Leon Morris in
his The Apostolic Preaching of the Cross, and the debate still continues in some circles to
this day.
From my study of the issue, I think it would be unwise to claim that such terms, as well
as related terms, only mean one or the other; there are some instances where these can
mean expiation, but there are clearly instances where it can mean propitiation and
others where both could be in view. One classical example would be Rom 3:25: 
Whom [Jesus] God put forward as a sacrifice of atonement (ἱλαστήριον) by his
blood, effective through faith. He did this to show his righteousness, because in
his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed.
(NRSV)
In this verse, the apostle Paul teaches us that God the Father provided Jesus as
a ἱλαστήριον. As it is the Father who proposed/planned (the meaning of the Greek
προτιθημι) his Son to be a place of ιλασμος/propitiation, translating it as propitiation
would be unusual—God planning Christ to be a sacrifice that appeases His own wrath—
contextually, it suits the meaning of “expiation,” that is, Christ as the means of our sins
being covered/remitted.
Notwithstanding, Num 16:46 explicitly states that the propitiation is for the purpose of
averting God’s anger against sin:
And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar,
and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an
atonement (LXX: εξιλασκομαι; Heb: כפר (for them: for there is wrath gone out
from the Lord; and the plague is begun.
Furthermore, in John 2:1-2, Christ is said to be our advocate (παρακλητος, the very
same term used of the Holy Spirit [KJV: Comforter] that the authors discussed), that is,
the person who pleads our cause before the Father (cf. Heb 7:25; Rom 8:33-34), and tied
into this, is John's statement that he is the propitiation (ιλασμος) for our sins. An
advocate seeks reconciliation between an offended party81 (the Father) and those who 
offended the party (us as sinners). Obviously, the concept of appeasement is in view
here.

Footnote:

81 In an attempt to rid the atonement of any sense of propitiation and the reality of God’s wrath against sin, C.H.
Dodd argued that expressions such as "the day of God's wrath" (Rom 2:5); "the law brings wrath" (Rom 4:15)
and "we will be saved from the coming wrath" (Rom 5:9) does "not describe the attitude of God to man, but to
describe the inevitable process of cause and effect in a moral sense" (The Epistle to the Romans, pp. 21-23).
A.T. Hanson, following Dodd, argued that "There can be little doubt that for Paul the impersonal character of
the wrath was important; it relived him of the necessity of attributing wrath directly to God" and "If you think of
the wrath as an attitude of God, you cannot avoid some theory of propitiation But the wrath in the New
Testament is never spoken of as being propitiated, because it is not conceived as being an attitude of God" (The
Wrath of the Lamb, pp. 69, 192). As one critic of Dodd et al correctly noted, this is eisegesis:
1) The New Testament contains instances in which God’s anger and wrath (Greek: οργη) are
personalized in the active voice, e.g., “God, the one inflicting wrath” (Rm 3:5); “God wishing to show
forth His wrath” (Rm 9:22). The former is one of four references to God’s present wrath (Rm 1:18; 2:5,
8; 3:5), which immediately precedes the reference in Rm 3:25 to Christ being the “propitiation” sent by
God for man’s sin, thus showing the connection between God’s wrath and the propitiation of
that wrath. 
2) Similar to “wrath” and “anger,” the New Testament uses words such as “grace” without
personalizing them or specifying their origin, e.g., “grace multiplied” (Rm 5:20); “the election of
grace” (Rm 11:5).
3) The statement “So I declared an oath in my anger, they shall never enter my rest in Hb 3:11; 4:3 is a
quote from Ps 95:11, whose contexts refers to God’s personal anger against the Israelites in the desert,
some of which Moses had propitiated (e.g., Exodus 32-33; Numbers 14). The writer of Hebrews
reminds the Christians of his day that the same anger of God rests upon those who now “turn away
from the living God” (Hb 3:12).
4) The LXX, using the Greek ιλασκομαι (hilaskomai) and its derivatives – although sometimes
referring to the “propitiation of sins” rather than propitiation of God’s wrath – the wrath, which the Old
Testament clearly envisions as an attitude of God, is included in the context (e.g., Ps 78:38-40:
“God...is propitiated for their sins...how often did they provoke him in the wilderness and anger him in
a dry land”; Lm 3:42-43: “we have sinned, we have transgressed, and you have not been
propitious...You have visited us in wrath, and driven us away” cf. Ps 25:11; 79:9). Similarly, Nm 16:46
explicitly states that the propitiation is for the purpose of averting God’s anger. All in all, however,
instances in the Old Testament in which propitiation and anger appear in the same context are as rare as
they are in the New Testament, and thus Hanson’s claims have no merit. (Robert Sungenis, Not by
Bread Alone, 291-92)

As has been noted by commentators, the Maccabean literature is important for
understanding the term ιλαστηριον ("place of atonement/propitiation" sometimes
rendered "mercy-seat" or "propitiatory"), such as 4 Macc 17:22, where propitiation, not
only expiation, is in view:
And through the blood of those devout ones [i.e., the Maccabean martyrs] and
their death as an atoning sacrifice [ιλαστηριον], divine Providence preserved
Israel that previously had been mistreated. (NRSV)
In other words, one must not engage, as some have done regardless of their translation
preference, make this into an either-or issue; it can be at times “both-and.”
One of the main arguments against the propitiation motif is that God’s wrath is often
relegated as a mere anthropomorphism. However, this results in a lot of fanciful
eisegesis of the biblical texts. Furthermore, as Latter-day Saints, this is one approach we
cannot take, as the reality of that wrath is emphasized time and time again in our canon,
and furthermore, God is often only appeased by personally appeasing Him, whether
through intercession (as in the case of Moses in Exo 32-33) or sacrifices. 
One of the best examples of this is the case of Phinehas who averted the wrath of God
from the Israelite camp. In Num 25 we read of some of the men of the Israelite camp
were engaging in cultic sexual intercourse with Moabite and Midianite women (e.g.,
Num 25:2-3, 6), resulting in God commanding Moses to kill them (Num 25:4), resulting
in 24,000 who died in the plague (Num 25:9). In defiance of this divine command, and
Israelite man brought a Midianite woman to his tent, more than likely to engage in such
cultic sexual intercourse. Phinehas, a priest, saw this happen and took the following
action:
And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest saw it, he rose
up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand; and he went
after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of
Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the
children of Israel. (Num 25:7-8)
As a direct result of the actions of Phinehas, God’s wrath was appeased (propitiated)
against the Israelite camp.
That God is not only loving but wrathful against our sins, was put rather well and very
succinctly by the Book of Mormon prophet Alma:
And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true, let us
repent, and harden not our hearts, that we provoke not the Lord our God to
pull down his wrath upon us in these his second commandments which he has
given unto us; but let us enter into the rest of God, which is prepared according
to his word. (Alma 12:37, emphasis added)
The model of atonement in The Christ Who Heals makes nonsense of this verse and
other passages in the Latter-day Saint canon.
That Christ Himself continues to appease God’s wrath against sin is found in D&C 45:3-
5:
Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause
before him—Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no
sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was
shed, the blood of him whom though gavest that thyself might be glorified.
Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they
may come unto me and have everlasting life. 
As we are told in D&C 38:4, the efficacy of Christ's intercession for us is grounded on
"the virtue of the blood which I have spilt."
Of course, there is an important caution when it comes to adopting the concept of
propitiation, and one that Leon Morris and others have correctly pointed out—that is,
we must not think of God being able to be simply “paid off” and have his wrath averted
against our sins like some pagan conceptions of propitiation that Dodd critiqued in his
work. This was discussed by Elder Joseph E. Robinson, Conference Report, April 1918, p.
47:
I know that it is written by John and Paul that Christ was offered as a propitiation
for our sins. I take it, if we had the original text we would learn that it was not in
the sense of appeasing the anger of God that he became a propitiatory gift. That
the Lord may have been, and has been, grieved and sometimes angry with his
stubborn people, I grant you, but I have never felt that God had to be "bought
off," if you will allow the expression, through the death of his Son, from visiting
upon us condition punishment. No. As I understand it, he gave us his best
loved gift, the First Born among many brethren in the spirit world, the only
begotten of God in the flesh, that we might know him and thus in knowing him
that we might be made free, "for this is life eternal, that they might know thee,
the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." He gave its the gift of
his Son that we should be won to him, that we should love him, for we give gifts
to those whom we would win, whom we would have love us, whom we would
draw to us, whom we would bring close in our affections, that they might be with
us and associate with us, and share with us our joys and good fortune. He gave
the Christ unto men that they might live again, that they might be made free, for
the truth should make them free in their worship, in their power of mind and in
their bodies, too, for that matter, and the redemption wrought out by the Christ
makes us all alive again in eternity, clothed upon with immortality and eternal
youth.
The reason why God is appeased with the sacrifice of Christ and forgives (expiates) our
sins is due to the strong covenantal/personal relationship Christ has with the Father,
and, by being united to Christ through the salvific covenant of baptism and other
covenants that engraft us to Christ (e.g., John 6:3-4; Gal 3:27), and as a result, we can
appropriate the salvific benefits of Christ’s atonement (remission of our sins; new
spiritual life; an advocate whose intercession will allow for the remission of our future
sins, etc), and not the “whimsical” concepts within pagan conceptions of atonement. 

While it is true that many ancients held to a view of God’s anger that was capricious and
whimsical, it would be wrong to jettison the theme of propitiation because of such
errors, as the authors do in the above quotes, as well as the following quote from
chapter 10, “The Collaborative Christ”:
We have tried to show that our Savior’s Atonement is more fully understood
within the context of a collaborative Godhead rather than as a defense against a
sovereign God’s wrath. (p. 74)
Apart from being a false dilemma, such an attitude towards the placating of God’s
(righteous, not whimsical) wrath against sin should not be compared to perversions of
such a model. As theologian John Stott correctly noted in his The Cross of Christ pp. 173-
75:
Secondly, who makes the propitiation? In a pagan context it is always human
beings who seek to avert the divine anger either by the meticulous performance
of rituals, or by the recitation of magic formulae, or by the offering of sacrifices
(vegetable, animal or even human). Such practices are thought to placate the
offended deity. But the gospel begins with the outspoken assertion that nothing
we can do, say, offer or even contribute can compensate for our sins or turn
away God’s anger. There is no possibility of persuading, cajoling or bribing God
to forgive us, for we deserve nothing at his hands but judgment . . . No, the
initiative has been taken by God himself in his sheer mercy and grace.
This was already clear in the Old Testament, in which the sacrifices were
recognized not as human works but as divine gifts. They did not make God
gracious; they were provided by a gracious God in order that he might act
graciously towards his sinful people...It is not that we loved God, but that he
loved us and sent his Son as a propitiation for our sins...God does not love us
because Christ died for us; Christ died for us because God loved us...What the
propitiation changed was his dealing with us . . . It is God himself who in holy
wrath needs to be propitiated, God himself who in holy love undertook to do the
propitiating, and God himself who in the person of his Son died for the
propitiation for our sins.
As S.R. Driver notes on the meaning of כפר in the Hebrew Bible, in this instance Deut
21:8 (“Be merciful, O Lord, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay
not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven
them”) wherein the LXX uses ἵλεως (BDAG: "pert. to being favorably disposed, with
implication of overcoming obstacles that are unfavorable to a relationship, gracious,
merciful") 
The note on 21:8 was so worded as to give the general sense of this term,
whether its primary meaning were assumed to be (from the Syriac) to wipe, wipe
off, or (from the Arabic) to cover. Although, however, there are many passages in
which the use of the word could be naturally explained upon the former
supposition, there are others (esp. Gn. 32:21) in which this is hardly the case: the
latter (which is also the usual explanation) must accordingly be deemed the
more probable one. The various applications of the word are best explained in
the note in Wellh. Comp. p. 335 f. Kipper is to cover—never, however, in a purely
literal sense (like בסה ,(but always morally, viz. with the collateral idea of
either conciliating an offended person, or screening an offence or an offender. It
is used in three applications. (1) Its most primary application appears in Gn.
32:21, where Jacob, in dread of Esau’s anger, says במנחה פניו רהֶפּ ְכ ַא ֲI will cover his
face with the present—i.e. conciliate him, the fig. being that of a person blinded
by a gift (Ex. 23:8, 1 S. 12:3) so as not to notice something (cf. Gn. 20:16). Hence
(face being omitted) kipper acquires the gen. sense of to conciliate, propitiate,
appease, the means employed (the פר ֶכּ ( ֹbeing, according to circumstances, a
gift, an entreaty, conciliatory behaviour, and esp. (see 2) a sacrifice: so Ex.
32:30 חטאתכם בעד רהֶפּ ְכ ַא ֲאולי) by intercession: v. 31f.), fig. Pr. 16:14 (of a king’s
wrath) יכפרנה חכם ואיש ,Is. 47:11 (of calamity) שחרהּ ||) כפרהּ תוכלי לא to charm it
away). The subst. kopher, lit. a covering, i.e. a propitiatory gift, is, however,
restricted by usage to a gift offered as an equivalent for a life that is claimed,—
the wergild so rigorously prohibited by Hebrew law (above, p. 234) in the case of
murder, but permitted in certain other cases, and evidently a familiar popular
institution. This sense of kopher illustrates 2 S. 21:3, where David says to the
representatives of the murdered Gibe˓onites פּר ֵכ ַא ֲמּה ָבַוּ wherewith shall
I make propitiation? the satisfaction demanded being the lives of Saul’s
sons who are thereupon sacrificed to appease Jehovah’s anger (v. 6; cf. v. 1,
24:1) See also Nu. 35:33, comp, with v. 31, 32. (2) In the distinctively priestly
phraseology (Ez. and P), the subject of kipper is the priest, the means a
sacrifice—usually the blood of the sin-offering, or the guilt-offering (אשם ,(
occasionally the burnt-offering (Lev. 1:4, 16:24), now and then something else:
the object was perhaps orig. יהוה פני) cf. Gn. 32:11, and יהוה פני חלּה ,(the verb being
construed absolutely, to perform a propitiatory rite, with על) on behalf of) the
person, less freq. with בעד) Lev. 9:7, 16:6, 11, 17, 24, Ez. 45:17); but the use of the
accus. of a material object (Lev. 16:20, 33, Ez. 43:20, 26, 45:20†) supports the
view that the idea involved is to cover up (cf. בעד חתם, על כסה ,(screen, viz. by a
propitiatory rite: there follows (if required) טן of the guilt from which one is freed
(Lev. 4:26, 5:6, 10, 16:16 al.), or על) on account of), Lev. 4:35, 5:13,
18, G usually ἐξιλάσχομαι. See more fully on Lev. 4:20. (3) Sometimes God is the
subject, who “covers”—i.e. treats as covered, overlooks, pardons, condones—
either (a) the offender, or (b) the offence: so (a) Dt. 21:8a, 32:43, Ez. 16:63, 2 Ch.
30:18; (b) Jer. 18:23, Ps. 65:4, 78:38, 79:9, Dan. 9:24 (obj. in all עון or פשעים .†(God
is also, no doubt, conceived as the implicit agent where the verb is passive: viz.
וסר עונך וחטאתך 7:6. Is), אם יתבפר עון בית עלי בזבח ובמנחה עד עולם) 14:3. S 1, 8b:21. D
ר ֶכֻתּ) ְthe means a purging or atoning rite); Is. 22:14 (means not specified); Is.
27:9, Pr. 16:6 עון פר ַכֻי ְובאמת בחסד) the means meritorious conduct): in all these
cases, the subj. is the iniquity, which, when the verb is in the active voice, is the
obj. in (3b), but never in (2). On Nu. 35:33, see above, No. 1, at the end. In actual
usage, the primary sense of covering was probably altogether forgotten. The
connexion between the three applications may, perhaps, be best preserved
by rendering in (1) and (2) propitiate, or make propitiation, and in (3) deal
propitiously with. (S.R. Driver, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on
Deuteronomy [3d ed.; Edinburgh, T&T Clark, 1902], 425-26, emphasis added)
Other instances where כפר is used in the sense of propitiate/appease, further refuting
the thesis of C.H. Dodd et al., include the following:

And you shall say, "Moreover your servant Jacob is behind us." For he thought, "I
may appease him (Heb: כפר ; LXX: ἐξιλάσκομαι) with the present that goes ahead
of me, and afterwards I shall see his face; perhaps he will accept me" (Gen 32:20
[v. 21 in Hebrew] NRSV)

A king's wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man will appease it (Heb: כפר ;
LXX: ἐξιλάσκομαι) (Prov 16:14 NRSV)
In LDS literature, one will find that many commentators have referred to Christ’s
sacrifice as a propitiation; others, expiation, and some have used both terms in the same
breath, showing that one cannot divorce one from the other. Consider the following
examples:
Use of “Propitiation”
Doctrine and Covenants (1835), p.57 (Lecture Fifth of Faith)
Q. Was he ordained of the Father, from before the foundation of the world, to be
a propitiation for the sins of all those who should believe on his name?
A. He was. I Peter, 1:18, 19, 20. For as much as you know that you were not
redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
conversation, received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was
foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last
times for you. Rev. 13:8. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, [the
beast] whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world. l Corin. 2:7. But we speak the wisdom of God in a
mystery, even the hidden mystery, which God ordained before the world unto
our glory.
Elder Joseph D. Robinson, Conference Report, April 1918, p.47
I know that it is written by John and Paul that Christ was offered as
a propitiation for our sins. I take it, if we had the original text we would learn
that it was not in the sense of appeasing the anger of God that he became a
propitiatory gift. That the Lord may have been, and has been, grieved and
sometimes angry with his stubborn people, I grant you, but I have never felt that
God had to be "bought off," if you will allow the expression, through the death of
his Son, from visiting upon us condign punishment.82
Marion D Hanks, Conference Report, April 1969, p.25
He died willingly, alone, for this was how it must be. There had to be
a propitiation, by one of his unique qualifications, for the sins of men -- our sins
-- payment for which, through the love of God and the love of his Son, was made
on Calvary's hill.83
James E. Talmage, The Articles of Faith, pp.77-78
4. Nature of the Atonement:—The atonement wrought by Jesus Christ is a
necessary sequence of the transgression of Adam; and, as the infinite
foreknowledge of God made clear to Him the one even before Adam was placed
on earth, so the Father's boundless mercy prepared a Savior for mankind before
the world was framed. Through the Fall, Adam and Eve have entailed the
conditions of mortality upon their descendants; therefore all beings born of
earthly parents are subject to bodily death. The sentence of banishment from the
presence of God was in the nature of a spiritual death; and that penalty, which was visited upon our first parents in the day of their transgression, has likewise
followed as the common heritage of humanity. As this penalty came into the
world through an individual act, it would be manifestly unjust to cause all to
eternally suffer therefrom, without a chance of deliverance. Therefore was the
promised sacrifice of Jesus Christ ordained as a propitiation for broken law,
whereby Justice could be fully satisfied, and Mercy be left free to exercise her
beneficent influence over the souls of mankind.d All the details of the glorious
plan, by which the salvation of the human family is assured, may not lie within
the understanding of man; but surely, man has learned from his futile attempts
to fathom the primary cause of the phenomena of nature, that his powers of
comprehension are limited; and he will admit, that to deny the effect because of
his inability to elucidate the cause, would be to forfeit his claims as an observing
and reasoning being.
James E. Talmage, The Articles of Faith, p.80
8. The many kinds of sacrifice prescribed by the Mosaic law are clearly classified
under the headings, bloody, and bloodless. Offerings of the first order only,
involving the infliction of death, were acceptable in propitiation or atonement
for sin
James P. Harris, The Essential James E. Talmage, p.149
The Atonement accomplished by the Savior was a vicarious service for mankind,
all of whom had become estranged from God through sin; and by that sacrifice
of propitiation, a way had been opened for reconciliation whereby man may be
brought again into communion with God, and be made able to live and advance
as a resurrected being in the eternal worlds. This fundamental conception is
strikingly expressed in our English word "atonement," which, as its syllables
attest is "at-one-ment," "denoting reconciliation, or the bringing
into agreement of those who had been estranged."
B. H. Roberts, The Truth, The Way, The Life, p.467
The Christ suffered for Adam's transgression, not for his own; and for the
transgression of all men; for the sins of the world. He suffered for all men, that
they might not suffer on certain conditions—the condition of repentance and
acceptance of the Christ (D&C 19:16-17). And that by reason of his stripes men
might be healed (Isa. 53:5, and Isa. 53:1-4). He made "propitiation" for men's sins (1 Jn. 2:2), and thus satisfied the claims of the law to the uttermost—even
unto death—the death of the cross. But it was not "possible that he should be
holden of it" (Acts 2:24)—i.e, of death; for he was Lord of life and of death. He
had power to lay down his life, and to take it up again.

Israelitish sacrifices may be conveniently classified as bloody and bloodless, the
former comprising all offerings involving the ceremonial slaughter of animals,
and the latter consisting in the offering of vegetables or their manufactured
products. The bloody sacrifices were early associated with the idea of expiation,
or propitiation for sin, the offerer, whether an individual or the community as a
whole, acknowledging guilt and craving propitiation through the death of the
animal made to serve as proxy for the human offender.
The animal victim intended for sacrificial death had to be chosen in accordance
with specific requirements. Thus, it was to he of the class designated as clean,
and within this class only domestic cattle and sheep and certain birds--pigeons
and turtle-doves--were acceptable. Furthermore, it was essential that the
selected animal be without physical defect or blemish; and thus all
that were deformed, maimed or diseased were absolutely excluded. Physical
defects were held as typical of spiritual blemish, or sin; and "God cannot look
upon sin with the least degree of allowance."
These requirements of relative perfection on the part of the victim were in
accord with the fact that the slaughter of animals as a priestly rite by Divine
direction was in prefigurement of the then future sacrifice of the Christ Himself,
whose atoning death would mark the consummation of His ministry in mortality,
while the animal victims slain on Israel's altars figuratively bore the sins of the
people, who in their observance of the sacrificial rite sought propitiation for
their offenses, or reconciliation with God, from whom they hail become
estranged through transgression, Jesus Christ actually bore the burden of sin and
provided a way for a literal reconciliation of sinful man to God. The principal
sacrifice in the Mosaic dispensation was that of the Passover; and the
superseding of the type by the actual is forcefully expressed by Paul: "For
even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us." (1 Cor. 5:7.)
Theologians, Bible scholars generally, and ethnologists as well, admit the
absence of all record both in the Bible and in profane history concerning the
origin of sacrifice. The writer of the article "Sacrifice" in one of our Bible Dictionaries (Cassell's), which article is in line with other learned commentaries,
says, following an array of facts: "On these and other accounts it has been
judiciously inferred that sacrifice formed an element in the primeval worship of
man; and that its universality is not merely an indirect argument for the unity of
the human race, but an illustration and confirmation of the first inspired pages of
the world's history. The notion of sacrifice can hardly be viewed as a product of
unassisted human nature, and must therefore be traced to a higher source and
viewed as a Divine revelation to primitive man."
Use of “Expiation”
President David O. McKay, Conference Report, April 1944, p.121
A young student recently expressed the thought that belief in Christ as the
Redeemer, as God made manifest, is waning; that professing Christians no longer
believe that Jesus is the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh; that in some
miraculous manner his death made expiation for sin; or that after His crucifixion
Christ rose from the dead.
President Hugh B. Brown, Conference Report, April 1962, p.108
The transgression of Adam, together with all of its consequences, was foreseen
and the expiation provided for before the foundations of the world were laid. In
that primeval council, of which the scriptures speak
George Q. Cannon, Journal of Discourses Vol. 11, p.68
The Lord has truly provided for us a plan of salvation that is as wide as eternity,
that is God-like in its nature and in its origin; it is intended to exalt us, his
children, and bring us back into his presence. For this purpose our Lord and
Savior came in the meridian of time. His blood was shed that an expiation might
be made by which the plan of salvation could be completed, that we, whose
bodies would otherwise continue subject to an everlasting sleep in the grave,
might have our mortal tabernacles resurrected and brought into the presence of
our Father and God, there to dwell eternally.
George Q. Cannon, Journal of Discourses vol. 15, p. 367 
those who contend for the same faith to know that slander, persecution,
ignominy and shame, and even death itself are not evidences of the falsity of a
system, or of the falsity of the doctrines taught by any individual, because we
have the history of the Apostles—some of the best men that have ever trod the
earth, and of Jesus, the holiest and best man that ever trod the earth, or that ever
will, and we find that he and they were persecuted, hated and despised, and their
names were east out as evil, and they were slain by a generation who professed
to honor God and be very righteous, and who claimed to be the descendants of
the Patriarchs of old, who were called the friends of God. If this story were told to
us without our knowing anything of the circumstances, we should be reluctant to
believe it. It would be a difficult thing to persuade us that human beings could
have been so base and degraded, and so lost to every feeling of humanity as to
persecute and crucify a pure being like Jesus, who had come from the Father for
the express purpose of laying down his life as an expiation for their sins.
The Latter-day Saints' Messenger and Advocate, Vol.1, No.3, p.35
The very idea of atonement or reconciliation, where there is so much guilt as
there is attached to the family of man, involves the idea of expiation in propria
persona or vicariously: For says the apostle, without shedding of blood is no
remission. There is one God and one Mediator between God and man, the man
Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time. We
who were once far off by reason of sin and rebellion, are made nigh by the blood
of Christ.
John Taylor, Mediation and Atonement, Ch.16, p.126 - p.127
As from the commencement of the world to the time when the Passover was
instituted, sacrifices had been offered as a memorial or type of the sacrifice of the
Son of God; so from the time of the Passover until the time when He came to offer
up Himself, these sacrifices and types and shadows had been carefully observed
by Prophets and Patriarchs; according to the command given to Moses and other
followers of the Lord. So also did He Himself fulfil this requirement, and kept the
Passover as did others; and now we, after the great sacrifice has been offered,
partake of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in remembrance thereof. Thus this
act was the great connecting link between the past and the future; thus He
fulfilled the law, met the demands of justice, and obeyed the requirements of His
Heavenly Father, although laboring under the weight of the sins of the world, and
the terrible expiation which He had to make, when, sweating great drops of
blood, He cried: "Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not my will be done," and when expiring in agony upon the cross He cried, "It is
finished," and gave up the ghost.
John Taylor, Mediation and Atonement, Ch.20, p.144 - p.145
In the economy of God pertaining to the salvation of the human family, we are
told in the Scriptures that it was necessary that Christ should descend below all
things, that He might be raised above all things; as stated above, He had to
"become subject to man in the flesh." It was further necessary that He
should descent below all things, in order that He might raise others above all
things; for if He could not raise Himself and be exalted through those principles
brought about by the atonement, He could not raise others; He could not do for
others what He could not do for Himself, and hence it was necessary for Him to
descend below all things that He might be raised above all things; and it was
necessary that those whom He proposed to save should also descend below all
things, that by and through the same power that He obtained His exaltation, they
also, through His atonement, expiation and intercession, might be raised to the
same power with Him; and, as He was the Son of God, that they might also be the
adopted sons of God; hence John says: "Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and
it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear,
we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."--1 John, iii, 2.
B. H. Roberts, The Truth, The Way, The Life, p.491
It can be readily understood that not even God's omnipotence could make it
possible for Him to act contrary to truth and justice. It ought to be no more
difficult to understand that God's omnipotence would not permit Him to set
aside a satisfaction to justice, any more than to grant an arbitrary concession to
mercy. Mere power has not the tight to nullify law, nor even omnipotence the
right to abolish justice. Might in Deity is not more fundamental than right. God,
we must conclude, will act in harmony with all His attributes, else confusion in
the moral government of the world. These reflections lead to the inevitable
confusion that there must be a satisfaction made to justice before there can be
redemption for man. They also lead to the confusion that the necessity
of expiation in order to pardon both Adam's transgression and secure
forgiveness of man's individual sins arise from the nature of the case, an existing
reign of law, and harmonious reactions to the attributes of God, and not from
arbitrary action. Justice is of such an absolute character that it would be as
impossible to save the guilty without an antecedent satisfaction to God's
attribute of justice as it would be for God to lie; and for God to lie would wreck the moral government of the universe, and result—if such a thing were
possible—in His dethronement.
B. H. Roberts, The Truth, The Way, The Life, p.504
We conclude, then, that for man's individual sins, as for Adam's transgression,
though differing in some respects already noted, involve the same necessity
of atonement. There is the same inexorableness of law; the same helplessness on
the part of man to make satisfaction for his sin; hence, man's dependence upon a
vicarious atonement, if he is to find redemption at all. There is the same need for
ability on the part of the one making the atonement to make full satisfaction to
justice by paying the uttermost farthing of man's obligations to the law; the idea
of satisfaction necessarily involves that of penal suffering. This couples together
the two ideas, satisfaction through expiation; or satisfaction to justice
through expiation. Whosoever redeems man from his individual sins must pay
the penalty due to sin by suffering in man's stead. No merely human sacrifice will
be adequate. As put by Alma, the Nephite prophet: "If a man murder, behold, will
our law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay. But the law
requireth the life of the murderer. Therefore, there can be nothing which is short
of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world (cf. Alma
34:11-12)."
James E. Talmage, The Vitality of Mormonism, Ch.14, p.60
We have learned but little of the eternal laws operative in the heavens; but that
God's purposes are accomplished through and by law is beyond question. There
can be no irregularity, inconsistency, arbitrariness or caprice in His doings, for
such would mean injustice. Therefore, the Atonement must have been effected in
accordance with law. The self-sacrificing life, the indescribable agony, and the
voluntary death of One who had life in Himself with power to halt His torturers
at any stage, and whom none could slay until He permitted, must have
constituted compliance with the eternal law of
justice, propitiation and expiation by which victory over sin and death could be
and has been achieved. Through the mortal life and sacrificial death of our Lord
Jesus Christ the demands of justice have been fully met, and the way is opened
for the lawful ministration of mercy so far as the effects of the Fall are concerned.

for whom are they held in reserve, and by whom are they to be enjoyed? Have
we an interest there? Do our fathers, who have waded through affliction and
adversity, who have been cast out from Scarce can the reflecting mind be
brought to contemplate these scenes, without asking, the society of this world,
whose tears have, times without number, watered their furrowed face, while
mourning over the corruption of their fellowmen, an inheritance in those
mansions? If so, can they without us be made perfect? Will their joy be full till we
rest with them? And is their efficacy and virtue sufficient, in the blood of a Savior,
who groaned upon Calvary's summit, to expiate our sins and cleanse us from all
unrighteousness? I trust, that as individuals acquainted with the gospel, through
repentance, baptism and keeping the commandments of that same Lord, we shall
eventually, be brought to partake in the fulness of that which we now only
participate the full enjoyment of the presence of our Lord. Happy indeed, will be
that hour to all the saints, and above all to be desired, (for it never ends) when
men will again mingle praise with those who do always behold the face of our
Father who is in heaven.
(2) The Nature of Christ's Intercessory Work
Christ's on-going work before the Father as High Priest and Heavenly Intercessor also
shows us that it is for the appeasing of God's (righteous) anger:

New Testament:

(Rom 8:34)
Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again,
who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. (End Rom 8:34) 

(Heb 2:17)
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he
might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make
reconciliation for the sins of the people. (End Heb 2:17)84

Footnote:
84 There are a number of interesting things when one examines this verse. Firstly, there are two “purpose
clauses” in this verse; the first (“that he might be a merciful high priest”) is the Greek ινα clause; the second is
the use of the Greek preposition εις which means “into” or “with a goal towards” and this is coupled with the
present infinitive form of the verb ιλασκομαι “to make atonement” (ιλασκεσθαι), and this present “making of
atonement” is “for the sins of the people” (τας αμαρτιας του λαου). The author of Hebrews views Christ’s ongoing office of heavenly intercessor as one that allows for the continuing appeasement of the Father to win the
forgiveness of sins committed by believers, sins that were not forgiven at one’s conversion. In other words, this
verse presents Jesus as the heavenly high priest who, even at present, makes atonement for sins; this is alien to
many theologies that think of one's forgiveness as being once-for-all. The author of Hebrews says Jesus makes
atonement for sins on an ongoing basis. If ones’ then-future sins were already atoned for when one appropriated
Jesus (esp. if one holds to imputed righteousness), and their justification can never be lost, this verse and its
theology is nonsensical. However, Christ's ongoing work as High Priest in the heavenly tabernacle is ongoing in
reference to our own sins. Thus, the present infinitive form in Heb 2:17 conclusively demonstrates the
continuing need for the application of Christ's work for our own salvation. Protestants are in the unenviable
position of having to advocate a soteriology that is at odds with the witness of biblical exegesis.
Paul Ellingworth, a Protestant, wrote the following about Heb 2:17 and the use of ιλασκεσθαι, further showing
that Jesus is a present propitiation (cf. 1 John 2:1-2):
The present verse suggests that he “became” high priest in order that he might continuously
deal (ἱλάσκεσθαι present) with the people’s sins . . . Ἱλάσκεσθαι (cf. ἱλαστήριον, 9:5*, “mercy-seat”)
is used in the NT only here and in Lk. 18:13**, where ἱλάσθητι means “be merciful” (cf. Est. 4:17h
LXX; Dn. Th. 9:19). The present ἱλάσκεσθαι denotes continuous activity by one who remains high
priest εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα (5:6 = Ps. 110[LXX109]:4) following his exaltation. (Paul Ellingworth, The
Epistle to the Hebrews: A Commentary on the Greek Text [New International Greek Testament
Commentary; Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1993], 186, 188, emphasis added)
This fits perfectly well with what we find in the Expositor's Greek New Testament (5 vols.), ed. Nicoll
Robertson, where Protestant scholar Marcus Dods wrote the following on Heb 2:17:
εἰς τὸ ἱλάσκεσθαι, “for the purpose of making propitiation,” εἰς indicating the special purpose to be
served by Christ’s becoming Priest. ἱλάσκομαι (ἱλάσκω is not met with), from ἵλαος,
Attic ἵλεως “propitious,” “merciful,” means “I render propitious to myself”. In the classics it is
followed by the accusative of the person propitiated, sometimes of the anger felt. In the LXX it occurs
twelve times, thrice as the translation of פּר ֵכּ . ִThe only instance in which it is followed by an accusative
of the sin, as here, is Psalms 64 (65):3, τὰς ἀσεβείας ἡμῶν σὺ ἱλάσῃ. In the N.T., besides the present
passage, it only occurs in Luke 18:13, in the passive form ἱλάσθητί μοι τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ, cf. 2 Kings 5:18.
The compound formἐξιλάσκομαι, although it does not occur in N.T., is more frequently used in the
LXX than the simple verb, and from its construction something may be learnt. As in profane Greek, it
is followed by an accusative of the person propitiated, as in Genesis 32:20, where Jacob says of
Esau ἐξιλάσομαι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς δώροις κ.τ.λ.; Zechariah 7:2, ἐξιλάσασθαι τὸν Κύριον,
and Zechariah 8:22, τὸ πρόσωπον Κυρίου, also Matthew 1:9. It is however also followed by an
accusative of the thing on account of which propitiation is needed or which requires by some rite or
process to be rendered acceptable to God, as in Sir 3:3; Sir 3:30; Sir 5:6; Sir 20:28, etc., where it is
followed by ἀδικίαν, and ἁμαρτίας; and in Leviticus 16:16; Leviticus 16:20; Leviticus 16:33, where it
is followed by τὸ ἅγιον, τὸ θυσιαστήριον, and in Ezekiel 45:20 by τὸν οἶκον. At least thirty-two times
in Leviticus alone it is followed by περί, defining the persons for whom propitiation is made, περὶ
αὐτοῦ ἐξιλάσεται ὁ ἱερεύς or περὶ πάσης συναγωγῆς, or περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν. In this usage there is
apparent a transition from the idea of propitiating God (which still survives in the passive ἱλάσθητι) to
the idea of exerting some influence on that which was offensive to God and which must be removed or
cleansed in order to complete entrance into His favour. In the present passage it is τὰς ἁμαρτίας τοῦ
λαοῦ which stand in the way of the full expression of God’s favour, and upon those therefore the
propitiatory influence of Christ is to be exerted. In what manner precisely this is to be accomplished is not yet said. “The present infinitive ἱλάσκεσθαι must be noticed. The one (eternal) act of Christ (c. x.
12–14) is here regarded in its continuous present application to men (cf. c. Hebrews 2:1-2).” (Marcus
Dods, "The Epistle to the Hebrews" in W. Robertson Nicoll, ed. The Expositor's Greek Testament,
volume 4 [Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1970], 269-70)

But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.

Footnote
85 On texts such as Heb 7:24-25 and 8:1, 3 which speak of Jesus, not simply sitting but engaged in activity and
the soteriological importance thereof, the following from Tobias Hägerland is apropos:
Forgiveness through the intercession of Jesus
While not as universally attested as the view of his death as salvific, the notion of Jesus’ continuous
intercession for those who have sinned surfaces in a number of texts that otherwise differ widely in
theological character. Paul expresses his conviction that Jesus ‘is at the right hand of God’ and
‘intercedes (εντυγχανει) for us’ (Rom 8.34), but he does not mention sins specifically. Likewise, the
author of Hebrews states that Jesus ‘can also save forever those who come to God through him, since
he always lives to intercede (εντυγχανειν) for them’ (Heb 7.25). It is possible in view of his subsequent
discussion of the high-priestly sacrifice for sins (7.26-7) that the author here envisages a ministry of
praying specifically for sins to be forgiven, but he does not say so explicitly.
First John clearly associates Jesus’ intercessory work with forgiveness claiming that ‘if somebody sins,
we have an advocate (παρακλητον) with the Father, Jesus Christ who is righteous’ (2.1). The notion
that the righteous departed pray for the forgiveness of the sins of the living is firmly rooted in several
variants of early Judaism, and the phrasing in First John is strikingly evocative of Philo’s articulation of
this conception. What Philo predicated of the ancient saints of Israel, First John attributes to Jesus: the
continuing ministry of praying before God on behalf of sinners, at least on behalf of those sinners who
have not committed mortal sin (see 5.16-17)
Luke’s narration of the death of Stephen (Acts 7.54-60) also assigns the role of advocate to Jesus.
Scholars have frequently taken Stephen’s invocation of Jesus, ‘Lord, do not hold (μη στησης) this sin
against them (7.60) as equivalent to saying ‘Lord, forgive this sin for them’ and thus as expressing the
notion that the heavenly Jesus forgives sins. But this interpretation appears to be based on the
misunderstanding of ‘to establish’ (ισταναι) and ‘to remit’ (αφιεναι) as antonyms in 1 Macc. 13.36-40;
15.2-9, where a careful reading reveals that these verbs are by no means anonymous. A more relevant
philological background for Stephen’s prayer is provided by the regulations concerning vows and
pledges in Num 30.11-15 LXX, which allow a husband either to nullify (περιαιρειν) his wife’s vows
and pledges by speaking out, or to validate (ισταναι) them by keeping silence. In the former case, ‘the
Lord will forgive (καθαρισει (MT: יסלח (( the woman (30.13). In Acts 7.60, Stephen analogously
petitions Jesus not to validate the sin of the assassins, but to nullify it by speaking on their behalf,
reserving for God the prerogative of properly forgiving their sin. This also explains better why Jesus is
standing, rather than sitting, at the right hand of God in Stephen’s vision (Acts 7.55-56): Jesus is not
functioning as a judge, but as the advocate of his faithful witness (cf. Luke 12:8-9), who exemplarily
asks him to speak also in favour of the enemies.
This understanding of Acts 7.60 affects the construal of Peter’s advice to Simon Magus, ‘ask the Lord
that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven for you’ (Acts 8.24). The identity of ‘the
Lord’ is obscure. If it refers to God, a post-baptismal sin may be forgiven by God without Jesus playing
any instrumental role (cf. 3.19). If, by contrast, it refers to Jesus, then his function could be understood
in either of two ways: as the one who actually forgives sins, or as the heavenly advocate, who
intercedes for the sinner before God. The contextual nearness between 7.60 and 8.22 speaks for the
latter alternative, as does the passive construction ‘will be forgiven’ (αφεθησεται), which may indicate
that the implicit agent of forgiveness is not identical with ‘the Lord’ to whom the prayer is addressed.

(Heb 8:1-3)
Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high
priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens. A
minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and
not man. For ever high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it
is of necessity that this man have somewhat to offer. (End Heb 8:1-3)

(Heb 9:22-23)
And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of
blood is no remission. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of the things in
the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves
with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places
made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, not to
appear in the presence of God for us. (End Heb 9:22-23)

(1 John 2:1-2)
My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we
have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. And he is the propitiation for our 
sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world87. (End 1 John 2:1-
2)

footnote:

86 Gk. Ιλασμος. Commenting on 1 John 2:2 and 4:10’s use of ιλασμος, and whether it means “propitiation” or
“expiation,” Stephen Smalley argued that it is “both-and” and not “either-or”:
Possibly these two interpretations of the term ιλασμος, one in which God is the subject of the action of
sin-offering, and one in which he is the object, need not be regarded as mutually exclusive. In the OT . .
. both senses prevail; and the same is true when, in the LXX, εξιλασκεσθαι ("to atone") is used (cf.
Zech 7:2; 8:22; Mal 1:9, the only occasions where this verb is used with an "objective" meaning; and 2
Kings 5:18, one of several "subjective" uses of the verb ιλασκεσθαι). Theologically it is in any case
true that God is the initiator of the Jewish principle and pattern of sacrifice for sin, as he is of the
surrounding framework of the Law (cf. Lev 16). But he also receives that sacrifice, so that atonement
may be made "for all the sins of the Israelites" (Lev 16:34). Similarly, in the NT, it is possible to argue
from such passages as Rom 3:21-26 that God both "presents" the "offering" of his Son (v 25, using
ιλαστηριον) as a means of the sinner's justification, and also “receive” it, so that he can justify “the man
who has faith in Jesus” (v 26).
Perhaps we should not use Paul to interpret John. Nevertheless in 1 John 2:2 (cf. 4:10) both senses of
ιλασμος also seem to be present. Jesus is regarded in this passage as a heavenly intercessor (v 1),
pleading the cause of the sinner and asking for his pardon. He does this, and can do it effectively,
because he is righteous, and is “himself” (αυτος) the offering (not the offerer!) for our sins (cf. v 7b).
To this extent God is the object of the saving action. But he is also the subject, since in v 9 we learn
that the forgiveness and purification of the sinner ultimately stem from the Father: he is righteous, and
on the basis of the Son’s offering he will forgive our sins. Here, then, is not contradict but
complementarity. John is declaring that the source of the offering is God the Father, but that
the means are to be found in God the Son; and our translation, “atoning sacrifice,” attempts to capture
both senses. (Stephen S. Smalley, 1, 2, 3 John [Word Biblical Commentary 55; Milton Keynes: Word
Books, 1991], 39-40, italics in original)

Footnote:

87 Gk κοσμος. With respect to the meaning of ιλασμος (“propitiation”) in texts such as 1 John 2:1-2, some
Reformed apologist (e.g., James R. White) have argued that this necessitates limited atonement, unless one
wishes to be an Universalist. As David Allen, a Southern Baptist and advocate of Universal Atonement noted in
response to White et al., this is fallacious:
With respect to the word “propitiation” (Gk. hilasmos), it is important to note that John uses the noun
form of the word and states that Christ is the propitiation for our sins and for the sins of the whole
world. As scholars have demonstrated, “propitiation” includes “expiation.” Advocates of limited
atonement often make a serious mistake when they make an invalid noun-to-verb conversion of the
noun “propitiation.” Nouns and verbs are distinct for a reason. Nouns speak to what a thing is or what it
does. Verbs speak to what a thing is doing or has done or shall do. Unlike verbs, nouns do not have a
tense. The result is to read “propitiation” as if it is speaking about the atonement as both
accomplished and applied—or accomplished with intent to apply effectually only to the elect. Christ is
viewed as actually propitiating and forgiving, and reconciling those for whom the propitiation was
made. But this is emphatically not what the verse says.
Once the illegitimate noun-to-verb transfer is made, then syllogistic arguments follow. For example, if
“world” means all people, this would entail that all humanity’s sin has been propitiated and expiated
(as an accomplished action with resulting salvation, according to limitarians); but given that it is not the
case and that the sins of all humanity have been expiated, “world,” therefore, cannot denote all
humanity. In other words:
1. If Christ has propitiated the wrath of God for a man (hypothetically named “Smith), then
that man cannot fail to be saved.
2. Christ has propitiated the wrath of God for Smith.
3. Therefore, Smith cannot fail to be saved.
Or, to rephrase the syllogism into a Modus Tollens argument:
If Christ died for the whole world, then the whole world will necessarily be saved.
It is not the case that the whole world is saved;
Therefore, it is not the case that Christ died for the whole world.
The syllogisms are formally valid but not logically sound because the first premise works only on the
noun-to-verb conversion. However, the noun hilasmos (“propitiation”), does not refer to an
accomplished past-tense action but to function—i.e., how something is accomplished. “Propitiation”
points back to Christ’s sacrifice for sins as a means for sinners to find forgiveness. The cross is
the means whereby one may find forgiveness—via an accomplished propitiation/expiation (noun) for
sins, not to an already accomplished application of the benefits of the atonement as subjective effect
already completed.
Consider 1 John 2:1 as a parallel example and comparable in structure to 1 John 2:2. John says, “If
anyone sins, we have an Advocate.” Here, Advocate (Gk. paraklēton) is a noun, and the sense is, if
anyone seeks pardon for his sins, there is an advocate for them. The sense is not that Christ has
already advocated (past tense verb indicated accomplished action) for them, but that He is their
“Advocate” or the Counselor to whom they may go to find help and comfort. That is, if they confess
their sin, He will advocate on their behalf. John is describing Christ’s office and function as
Advocate—what He will accomplish with regard to those who confess their sins.
John’s point in 1 John 2:2 is that there is an accomplished, objective atonement that provides an
ongoing means for subjective reconciliation to occur between a sinner and God when the sinner comes
to God through Christ by faith. Propitiation accomplished does not, and cannot, ipso facto mean
propitiation applied. Without repentance there can be no advocacy applied (1 John 2:1), and without faith in Christ there can be no propitiation applied. Christ’s death on the cross has made propitiation for
the sins of all people and is objectively available—conditionally as to its efficacy to all who will come
to God through Christ by faith. If any person confesses his sin, he will find in Christ an Advocate,
because Christ is “the propitiation for our sins, and not or ours only but also for the whole world.”

Doctrine and Covenants

(D&C 45:3-5) 
Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause
before him-saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin,
in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the
blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified; wherefore, Father, 
spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me
and have everlasting life. (End D&C 45:3-5)

The theme of the appeasement of the anger of God is explicated throughout the LDS
canon, including the Book of Mormon. After Nephi “saw that the people had repented and
did humble themselves in sackcloth” (Helaman 11:9), we read:
O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept away the band of
Gadianton from amongst them insomuch that they have become extinct, and they
have concealed their secret plans in the earth. Now, O Lord, because of this their
humility wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in
the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed. O
Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and cause that
this famine may cease in this land. O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause
that it may be done according to my words, and send forth rain upon the face of
the earth, that she may bring forth her fruit, and her grain in the season of grain.
O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let there be a famine, that
the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt, even at this
time, hearken unto my words, for thou saidst that: If this people repent I will spare
them. Yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the
famine and the pestilence and destruction which has come unto them. And
now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try again if they will serve
thee? And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy words which thou
hast said. (Helaman 11:10-16)

Such should be compared with other texts that speak of (1) the reality of God's wrath
against sin; (2) its necessary appeasement/propitiation and (3) that such is not
whimsical or capricious, unlike other ancient understandings thereof, such as: 

(D&C 98:47-48)
But if the children shall repent, or the children's children, and turn to the Lord
their God, with all their hearts and with all their might, mind, and strength, and
restore four-fold for all their trespasses wherewith they have trespassed, or
wherewith their fathers have trespassed, or their father's fathers, then thine
indignation shall be turned away. And vengeance shall no more come upon
them, saith the Lord thy God, and their trespasses shall never be brought any more
as a testimony before the Lord against them. (End D&C 98:47-48)

(Ether 1:36) 
Then Jared said unto his brother: Cry again unto the Lord, and it may be that
he will turn away his anger from them who are our friends, that he confound not
their language. (End Ether 1:36) 

(Ether 2:8-11, 15)
And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso should
possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should serve
him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the fulness of his
wrath should come upon them. And now, we can behold the decrees of God
concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall
possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his
wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon
them when they are ripened in iniquity. For behold, this is a land which is choice
above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be
swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of
iniquity among the children of the land, that they are swept off. And this
cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of God-- that ye
may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that
ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you as the
inhabitants of the land have hitherto done . . . And the brother of Jared repented
of the evil which he had done, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his
brethren who were with him. And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and
thy brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin any more, for ye shall remember
that my Spirit will not always strive with man; wherefore, if ye will sin until
ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And these
are my thoughts upon the land which I shall give you for your inheritance; for it
shall be a land choice above all other lands. (End Ether 2:8-11, 15)

This mirrors the propitiatory appeasement of God by Moses in Exo 32-33. Let us look at
it in point by point format:88

1. God determines to destroy all of Israel for worshipping the golden calf.
2. Moses pleads with God to relent, reiterating the promise to Abraham and the
potential mockery from Egypt.
3. God rescinds His threat to destroy all of Israel, yet punishes the leading
perpetrators.
4. Moses spends 40 days prostrate and fasting to appease God for Israel’s sin.
5. Although temporarily appeased, God refuses to go with the Israelites through
the desert, because they are so “stiff-necked” he “might destroy them on the
way.”
6. Moses pleads again with God to change His mind.
7. God changes His mind and decides to go with them.
8. God then remarks on the intimate relationship He has with Moses as the basis
of His decision to change His mind.
9. God confirms this intimate relationship by showing Moses part of His actual
appearance.

88 Commenting on the topic of intercession and the placating of God’s anger against sins, Staníslaus Lyonnet
wrote the following which is apropos:
Expiation and Intercession
In those rare passages where the two terms “expiation” and “anger” are found together, we notice that
it is in association with prayer. This is true in the expiation of Moses (Ex 32:30; cf. 32:11), and in the
case of Aaron (Nm 17:11ff.) according to the interpretation of Wis 18:21-25; see that of Phineas
according to the Targum (cf. Ps 106:30); and it is especially clear in the case of the Servant of Yahweh
whose role as intercessor is mentioned four times (Targum Is 5:4, 7, 11, 12). St. Jerome had this notion
of expiation in mind when (following the usage of the old Latin versions) he translated the stereotyped
phrase which concludes the description of the sacrifices for sin, “to make atonement for them,” (Lv
4:20, 26, 31, etc.) by a verb which had the meaning “to pray” or “to intercede.”
It is not surprising, then, to find in the Epistle to the Hebrews the essential function of the priestly
activity of Christ as he enters into heaven described in terms of “intercession” (Heb 7:25; 9:24). He is
seen as the High Priest who has gone beyond the veil to perform the sacrificial rite par excellence, the
sprinkling of his blood on the propitiatory.
This underscores the importance of the interior dispositions of the one who is making the expiation.
The external gesture is only the expression of the internal spiritual act, and it is no substitute for it. It is
also evident that man’s expiatory acts are not some kind of an attempt to force God to be propitious.
When Wisdom describes the intercession of Aaron, it is careful to note that his prayer consists in
recalling to God the oaths and agreements given to the forefathers (Wis 18:22). Such a prayer is
basically an act of faith in the faithful love of Yahweh. Seen in this way, expiation has for its purpose
not to change the dispositions of God (except as man sees it), but to dispose man to receive the gift of
God. (Staníslaus Lyonnet, “Expiation,” in John R. Sheets, ed., The Theology of the Atonement:
Readings in Soteriology [Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967], 99-101, here, pp. 100-1)

What Moses (and Helaman) and other intercessors did in an imperfect manner, Christ,
through His atoning sacrifice and intercessory work before the Father, does in a perfect
manner. Indeed, we should not think that Christ’s work was, reverently speaking, “done
and dusted” 2,000 years ago—instead, it continues and will continue, as we read in the
Doctrine and Covenants, “until the fulness of times, when Christ shall have subdued all
enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work” (D&C 76:106). Such is also
beautifully summed up in the second stanza of the hymn, “O Thou, Before the World
Began “(no. 189 in the current [1985] LDS hymnal), which reads as follows:
Thy off’ring still continues new before the righteous Father’s view.
Thy self the Lamb for ever slain; thy priesthood doth unchanged remain.
Thy years, O God, can never fail, nor thy blest work within the veil.
Other texts in uniquely Latter-day Saint Scripture also explicates the theme one divine
wrath, propitiation, and divine retribution, such as: 

(Helaman 13:30-39) 
Yea, behold, the anger of the Lord is already kindled against you; behold, he hath
cursed the land because of your iniquity. And behold, the time cometh that he
curseth your riches, that they become slippery, that ye cannot hold them; and in
the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them. And in the days of your poverty
ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already
come upon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and
howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts. And then shall ye lament, and say: O
that I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and stoned them, and cast
them out. Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered the Lord our
God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become
slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.
Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it is gone; and behold, our swords
are taken from us in the day we have sought them for battle. Yea, we have hid up
our treasures and they have slipped away from us, because of the curse of the
land. O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord came unto us;
for behold the land is cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we cannot
hold them. Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by
the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls. Behold, our iniquities are
great. O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us? And this shall be
your language in those days. But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have
procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your
destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for
that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing
iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in
our great and Eternal Head. O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my
words! And I pray that the anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that
ye would repent and be saved. (End Helaman 13:30-39) 

(3 Nephi 9:1-13) 
And it came to pass that there was a voice heard among all the inhabitants of the
earth, upon all the face of this land, crying: Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto
the inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall repent; for the devil
laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and
daughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquity and abominations that
they are fallen! Behold, that great city Zarahemla have I burned with fire, and the
inhabitants thereof. And behold, that great city Moroni have I caused to be sunk
in the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof to be drowned. And behold,
that great city Moronihah have I covered with earth, and the inhabitants thereof,
to hide their iniquities and their abominations from before my face, that the
blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come any more unto me against
them. And behold, the city of Gilgal have I caused to be sunk, and the inhabitants
thereof to be buried up in the depths of the earth; Yea, and the city of Onihah and
the inhabitants thereof, and the city of Mocum and the inhabitants thereof, and
the city of Jerusalem and the inhabitants thereof; and waters have I caused to
come up in the stead thereof, to hide their wickedness and abominations from
before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come up
any more unto me against them. And behold, the city of Gadiandi, and the city of
Gadiomnah, and the city of Jacob, and the city of Gimgimno, all these have I
caused to be sunk, and made hills and valleys in the places thereof; and the
inhabitants thereof have I buried up in the depths of the earth, to hide their
wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the blood of the
prophets and the saints should not come up any more unto me against them. And
behold, that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by the people of king
Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire because of their sins and their
wickedness, which was above all the wickedness of the whole earth, because of
their secret murders and combinations; for it was they that did destroy the peace
of my people and the government of the land; therefore I did cause them to be
burned, to destroy them from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and
the saints should not come up unto me any more against them. And behold, the
city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen,
have I caused to be burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof, because of their
wickedness in casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom I did send to
declare unto them concerning their wickedness and their abominations. And
because they did cast them all out, that there were none righteous among them, I
did send down fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and abominations
might be hid from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints
whom I sent among them might not cry unto me from the ground against them.
And many great destructions have I caused to come upon this land, and upon this
people, because of their wickedness and their abominations. O all ye that are
spared because ye were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto
me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you? (End 3 Nephi 9:1-13)

(D&C 82:1-3) 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, my servants, that inasmuch as you have forgiven
one another your trespasses, even so I, the Lord, forgive you. Nevertheless, there
are those among you who have sinned exceedingly; yea, even all of you have
sinned; but verily I say unto you, beware from henceforth, and refrain from sin,
lest sore judgments fall upon your heads. For of him unto whom much is given
much is required; and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the
greater condemnation. (End D&C 82:1-3) 

Jennifer C. Lane (Faculty of Religious Education, BYU-Hawaii) had an insightful
discussion of Jesus “treading the winepress” of God’s wrath against sin (which, of
necessity, would require the atonement being propitiatory, not merely expiatory) and
our free-will ability to accept or reject the Gospel and other important soteriological
issues which ties nicely into our present discussion:
Judgment and the Winepress
Both Isaiah and the book of Revelation connect the winepress with the wrath of
God. We sometimes see that wrath pointed against us, but let’s look more closely
at the language in Revelation 19. Here we see Christ coming to rule and reign. He
is “clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of
God” (19:13). Verse 15 points to his right to judge and rule: “and out of his mouth
goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule
them with a rod of iron.” But it also stresses that “he treadeth the winepress of
the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.”
Recognizing the winepress was “the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God” is a
critical point that we sometimes overlook. The consequences of our sins result in
what scripture describes as the “wrath of God.” To use another image, this
winepress is the bitter cup that should have been ours, but Christ drank it for us.
At the temple at Bountiful, directly after announcing himself as Jesus Christ, “the
light and the life of the world.” Christ tells the people: “I have drunk out of that
bitter coup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in
taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the
Father in all things from the beginning” (3 Nephi 11:11). Drinking this cup of
wrath for us, “treading the winepress alone,” this is what he is offering to take
from us. His willingness to tread the winepress, to drink the bitter cup, also
shapes the meaning of the cup that he gives us to drink.
Christ takes the cup of wrath, the cup of indignation. By drinking the bitter cup of
the consequences of all that we have done to offend God, Christ frees us from
what should have been our fate. He partakes of the consequences of our life and
offers us instead the chance to partake of his life, to enjoy his unity with the
Father and the fullness of his Spirit. The bitterness of all that we have chosen did
not just disappear. He drank that bitter cup in our place. What Christ has done in
treading the winepress as he suffered for our sins puts us in a relationship with
him that we cannot ignore.
And so, as we read the passages about Christ treading the winepress alone,
hopefully we can see the price that he paid in treading “the winepress of the
fierceness and wrath of Almighty God” (Revelation 19:15). He doesn’t just want
us to feel sorry for him. He wants us to know that his life is so deep that, like the
legend of the pelican, he shed his blood to give us life. He wants us to know that
his life is so deep that he would do anything to keep us from receiving the eternal
consequences of our choices. “Thus saith thy Lord the Lord, and thy God that
pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of
trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it
again” (Isiah 51:22). As he treads the winepress alone, he is pleading with us to
accept his suffering on our behalf. That is what he wants for us more than
anything else. He wants us to “no more drink” the cup of trembling and the cup of
God’s wrath.
How could he more fully communicate his desire to redeem us? “I have trodden
the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me” (Isaiah 63:3).
None could be with him because he did this for all us. As Abinadi testified, “Thus
all mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost were it 
not that God redeemed his people from their lost and fallen state” (Mosiah 16:4).
The redemption price was paid, and Christ will return in a red robe so that we
will know what he suffered on our behalf in that winepress. But, as a prophet of
God, Abinadi also testified that even the redemption of Christ cannot overpower
human agency (see Mosiah 16:5). He has trodden “the winepress of the
fierceness and wrath of Almighty God,” but we must let him take out of our hand
the cup of trembling. We must let go of the cup of wrath and accept instead the
blood of the covenant.
If we do not choose faith, repentance, and making and keeping covenants, we are
instead choosing to persist in our “own carnal nature, and [go] on in the ways of
sin and rebellion against God.” Of those who make this choice, Abinadi warns
that they “[remain] in [their] fallen state and the devil hath all power over
[them]. Therefore [they are] as though there was no redemption made, being an
enemy of God; and also is the devil an enemy to God” (Mosiah 16:5). Perhaps this
is why judgment imagery is interwoven with the imagery of Christ treading the
winepress alone. How we respond to his suffering on our behalf becomes our
judgment. Without choosing to receive his gift with our faith and repentance,
coming unto him on the covenant path, we will someday know that he will
redeem us, but we did not want to be redeemed. He offers to take away the cup
of wrath and replace it with the cup of his blood, his life, his fullness. We decide.
We will receive that we are willing to receive. (Jennifer C. Lane, Finding Christ in
the Covenant Path: Ancient Insights for Modern Life [Provo and Utah: BYU
Religious Studies Center and Deseret Book, 2020], 126-28)

In his The Mediator, Swiss theologian Emil Brunner (1889-1966) wrote the following
which is rather apropos as he argues against the claim, popularized by C.H. Dodd in The
Bible and the Greeks (1935) that God having a wrath and the need for appeasement
thereof is opposed to the witness of the Bible and is derived from fickle pagan deities
who had to be propitiated by their followers:
The God who is really angry, really loves. To reject the idea of the wrath of God
also means to reject His Love. Then all that is left, both negatively and positively,
is the abstract idea of law. The idea that God is angry is no more anthropopathic
than the thought that God loves. The reason why the idea of the divine anger is
always exposed to misunderstanding is because among men anger is ethically
wrong. And yet, even among men do we not speak of a “righteous anger”? And
does not the flame of righteous anger show that love also is truly personal? To
banish all emotions from the sphere of the Divine Good is not the work of
Christian thought but of “Greek-modern,” that is, rational thought.
God is angry because He is personal, because He really loves. The Bible speaks so
naturally about the divine wrath, even in the New Testament, because it is so full
of the thought of the personal love of God, which is something quite different
from the “rational moral purposive will.” Once again, this is not a relic of
primitive thought . . . God is angry. What does that mean to the man who knows
this? That a disaster is hanging over him which he cannot avert. He knows the
cause: his unfaithfulness. But along with this sense of impending disaster goes 
also the sense of his impotence to avert this disaster by any merely interior or
ethical means. The nearest approach to such an attempt would be an inward
transformation at the very centre of the disturbance, which is indeed the
personal relation, that is, to return to the original personal relationship. Ah! if
only this were possible! But the way to this possibility is blocked by a double
barrier: inability to achieve this, and also the feeling that it would not be
permitted; in other words, sin which cannot be rooted out, and guilt which can
never be made good. If ever the way to God is to be reopened and the normal
relationship restored, something else will have to take place. This process would
be expiation.
In the ancient rites and ideas of expiation something of this vital truth still lives;
otherwise it scarcely exists anywhere else—in mysticism least of all. Of course,
we are aware of the primitive nature and the inadequacy of all these religious
means of expiation. But it is more than doubtful whether the rejection of these
ideas in favour of a non-ritual religious ethic brings us any nearer to the truth
than the practice of these rites. It is difficult to say which of these two is nearer to
the truth: rational moralism, or primitive religion with its propitiatory rites; for
both have preserved one element of truth and have lost another. Rational
moralism recognizes the insufficiency of all human means of expiation; sacrificial
religion recognizes the need for the expiatory sacrifice. Hence the truth resides
in that expiatory sacrifice which is not offered by man but by God, and therefore,
because it is a divine transaction, has been offered once for all. (Emil
Brunner, The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian
Faith [trans. Olive Wyon; London: The Lutterworth Press, 1934], 478-79)

(3) Christ's atonement is for "aftershocks" of sin?
Christ's sacrifice is not simply for the "aftershocks" of sin (p. 55) merely. Christ is
constantly referred to being a "sin sacrifice" and other like-terms. For instance, Isa
53:10 (quoted by Abinadi in Mosiah 14:10 and interpreted to be a prophecy of Christ),
reads: 
Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt
make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days,
and the pleasures of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. (End Isa 53:10)

Footnote:

89 While this passage is often touted in support for the Penal Substitutionary model of atonement, such is not the
case. While disagreeing with his apologetic for the Roman Mass in his book, Catholic apologist Robert
Sungenis is corrected in his critique of the Protestant interpretation of the Fourth Servant Song when he writes:
Most Protestants contend that Isaiah 53 pictures Christ paying the legal penalty of sin, many holding
that Christ suffered the torments of hell to pay for sin (Luther and Calvin), yet nowhere in the passage
is this specified. Phrases such as “pierced for our transgressions,” “crushed for our iniquities,” “the
chastisement that brought our peace was upon him” (vr. 5), “the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us
all” (vr. 6), “for the transgression of my people he was stricken” (vr. 8), “he will bear their iniquities”
(vr. 11) and “bore the sin of many” (vr. 12) merely give the reason Christ suffered and died, but do not
speak of these as the legal and eternal punishment for sin; rather, they are the means by which Christ
“made intercession for transgressors” (vr. 12) so that God would “see the suffering of his soul and be
satisfied” (vr. 11). This agrees with Scripture, which interprets the prophetic statements concerning
Christ’s coming as a time of suffering and dying, not as experiencing the torments of hell (e.g., Mk
9:12; Lk 24:25-26; Ac 3:18; 1Co 15:3-4). God is not legally satisfied by Christ’s suffering and death,
but personally satisfied, for there was no law requiring Christ to offer Himself, and no law requiring
God to accept a legal rectification . . . William Hogan [writes]: “The value of His acts of satisfaction
can be measured from Christ’s personal innocence, and from the fact that all His human acts were
charged with obedience and charity. This interior spirit made all His deeds pleasing to his Father — at
least as pleasing as the sins of men were displeasing; His acts were thus capable of offsetting the denial
of God’s glory implicit in man’s sin. The ‘balance of justice’ is not found in a certain degree of pain
countering the offense given by a certain number of sins. The balance is found in the dignity and worth
of the honor given to God countering the offense given by sin....The sacrifice gave a more than
adequate compensation for the injury done by sin and is, therefore, an act of satisfaction...The
satisfaction given by Christ is aimed at the elimination of guilt; it opens the way to man’s reception of
new life and consequent reunion with God” (Christ’s Redemptive Sacrifice, pp. 82, 85). (Robert A.
Sungenis, Not by Bread Alone, 34 n. 34; square brackets added for clarification)
S.G. Burney, a 19th-century critic of penal substitution, noted the following problems with the Reformed
reading:
Remarks.—however strong these citations from Isaiah liii may appear, the entire contents of the
chapter can never be harmonized with the penal theory. We consequently are under the necessity of
making the prophet contradict either himself or the penal theory.
This might be shown from a comparison of many expressions in the chapter; but it is sufficient to direct
attention to the following:
(1) “When thou shalt make his soul [life] an offering for sin.” His death was sacrificial and therefore
not penal, for, as we have seen, a penal sacrifice is a contradiction in the adjective.
(2) “He shall see his seed”—see those to whom his own nature is imparted, or who are born of God. If
he died a penal death, then he imparts penal righteousness to men, and saints and Satan are clothed in
the same garments, as we have previously seen.
(3) “Shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.” How can the fruits of penalty be a source of
satisfaction to the penalty bearer? Penalty, as we have seen, can not satisfy God, for he is angry with
the wicked (the only penalty bearers) every day; nor satisfy justice, which is defrauded by all penalty
bearers of its claims to their loving obedience; least of all, how can penalty satisfy the penalty bearer,
for, having no power to remove its cause, it is neither a satisfaction in itself nor the means of
subsequent satisfaction.
On the contrary, if Christ’s travail was such as comes from loving fidelity, then we can very readily see
how can be satisfied with the fruits of that travail. It is like the satisfaction that comes to the generous
benefactor, or to the self-sacrificing mother, who contemplates with ineffable pleasure the restoration
of a sick child which her travail of soul has instrumentality saved from death.
(4) “By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many.” If this text read: By his penal
sufferings my unrighteous enemy shall justify any, then it would be in harmony with penal substitution.
But reading as it does, all the exegetes and casuists in Christendom can not harmonize it with the penal
scheme. This nothing but the most defiant dogmatism can do.
The terms knowledge, righteous, servant, and justify, each of itself excludes penality.
If Christ justifies men by substitutionary suffering, then he does not justify them by his knowledge. If
he is a penal substitute for sinners, then he is confessedly guilty or unrighteous, and if he is guilty, then
he is not a servant in the sense in which Christ is recognized as such; and if he is not perceptively
righteous, then he can not be righteous or justify others, except with the penal righteousness, with
which Satan himself is justified.
We can not know precisely how Christ by his knowledge justifies many, but we know the fact. We
know the fact that the physician by his knowledge restores the patient; that the wise man may impart
his wisdom to others without being able fully to comprehend the process. So of Christ’s knowledge in
justifying many. We know that he “learned obedience by the thing which he suffered, [thus] being
made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” (Heb. v. 8, 9.) 
By the knowledge thus “learned” he is able to justify or make righteous those that obey him by making
them partakers of his own righteousness, etc. (Heb. x. 12; 2 Peter i. 4.)
(5) “Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong.”
For his services God “hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name.”
(Phil. ii. 9-11.)
How could God so honor one for the righteousness that consists in bearing a penalty? The idea seems
preposterous in the extreme.
(6) “And made intercession for transgressors.” This finds one striking verification in the prayer on the
cross: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” (Luke xxiii. 34.)
I have had frequent occasion to say that if the penal theory is true—if pardon is based upon punishment
and comes necessarily out of it, as all consistent penalists hold, then prayer, intercession, and every
other means are worthless. If God has made punishment the condition of pardon, then to intercede or
pray for pardon is a reflection upon the divined integrity.
Yet Christ prayed for his persecutors. If that has not any pertinency or significance in it, and we know
it has, then it proves beyond all reasonable question that his sufferings did not offset the guilty and
infallibly insure the salvation of all for whom he died, as substitutionists teach.
These quotations, taken from the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, can not be harmonized with the doctrine
of substitution. They, by their logical consequences, contradict it. Hence, it follows, if that doctrine is
true, the prophet contradicts himself. Or, if he does not contradict himself, he squarely contradicts the
doctrine, and penalists egregiously misinterpret the prophet. His language can not mean what they
assume it to mean. (S.G. Burney, Atonement Soteriology: The Sacrificial, in Contrast with the Penal,
Substitutionary, and Merely Moral or Exemplary Theories of Propitiation [Nashville: Cumberland
Presbyterian Publishing House, 1888], 261-64
Further problematic for this reading is Isa 53:11, where the Servant is said to justify many "by his knowledge."
In this verse, we read that the Messiah's people will be justified, not by an imputation of an alien righteousness,
but by (ב (the knowledge (עת ַדּ .(ַThat Isaiah does not understand עת ַדּ ַas anything other than
intellectual/experiential knowledge, and not an imputed righteousness, can be seen in the other instances it is
used in the book of Isaiah:
Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge (עת ַדּ :(ַand their
honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst. (Isa 5:13)
And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of
counsel and the might, the spirit of knowledge (עת ַדּ (ַand the fear of the Lord. (Isa 11:2)
And wisdom and knowledge (עת ַדּ (ַshall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear
of the Lord is his treasure. (Isa 33:6)
With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and
taught him knowledge (עת ַדּ ,(ַand shewed to him the way of understanding? (Isa 40:14)
And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge (עת ַדּ (ַnor understanding to say, I have
burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh,
and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a
tree? (Isa 44:19)
That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and
maketh their knowledge (עת ַדּ (ַfoolish (Isa 44:25)
For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge
(עת ַדּ ,(ַit hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me. (Isa
47:10) 

Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know (עת ַדּ (ַmy ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and
forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in
approaching God. (Isa 58:2)
Some may be tempted to argue that the Hebrew phrase תּוֹ֗ע ְדַבּ ְwould best be translated as an objective genitive
(i.e., by knowledge of the Messiah). However, the context does not allow for it. As John Goldingay and David
Payne noted:
53.11 aβb. By his knowledge my servant will show many that he is indeed just, because he bears
their wrongdoing. We link b
eda’tȏ with what follows, with the MT, Tg, and 1Qsa
 (which prefixes w to
the word). Out of this context b
eda’tȏ could be an objective genitive, ‘by knowledge of him’. That
might then denote people’s knowledge/ acknowledgement of the servant or the servant’s knowledge/
acknowledgement of Yhwh, though the expression is once again allusive. But the link with the opening
subsection (52.13) suggest that it is rather the more common subjective genitive, ‘by his knowledge’.
As that first subsection opened by declaring that Yhwh’s servant would act with insight, so the last
subsection opens by declaring what Yhwh’s servant will achieve through his knowledge. (John
Goldingay and David Payne, Isaiah 40-55: A Critical and Exegetical Commentary, volume
II [International Critical Commentary; London: Bloomsbury, 2014], 325)

[In Isa 53:10]
The term "offering for sin" in Hebrew is שׁם ָא ָand in the LXX is περι αμαρτιας, a technical
term for a "sin offering" or "sin sacrifice" (cf. its usages in Num 29:11, 16, 19, 22, 25, 38,
31, 34, 38 for example). 

1 Pet 2:24 is another text of importance:
Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead
to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. (End 1 Pet 2:24)

The verb translated as "bare" is αναφερω, which is a sacrificial term. This verb is used
ten times in the Greek New Testament in contexts of "lifting up" or "offering sacrifices"
(e.g., Matt 17:1; Mark 9:2; Luke 24:51; Heb 7:27; 9:28; 13:15; 1 Pet 2:5). Note how the
verb is defined in BGAD: 
3. to offer as a sacrifice, offer up, specif. a cultic t.t. (SIG 56, 68; Lev 17:5; 1 Esdr

The earliest interpretation of this passage comes from Polycarp90 (65-155) in his Epistle
to the Philadelphians chapter 8 : 
Let us then continually persevere in our hope, and the earnest of our
righteousness, which is Jesus Christ, "who bore our sins in His own body on the
tree," "who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth," but endured all
things for us, that we might live in Him. Let us then be imitators of His patience;
and if we suffer for His name's sake, let us glorify Him. For He has set us this
example in Himself, and we have believed that such is the case. (ANF 1:35)
In other words, Jesus' bearing of sins is, for Polycarp, his enduring "all things for us that
we might live for Him."

Footnote:

90 That Polycarp did not believe in forensic justification and atonement can be seen when one examines the rest
of his writings. Indeed, just as as Paul teaches, a faith that works through love (Gal 5:6) and that our being saved
is contingent upon enduring to the end:
I have greatly rejoiced with you in our Lord Jesus Christ, because ye have followed the example of true
love [as displayed by God], and have accompanied, as became you, those who were bound in chains,
the fitting ornaments of saints, and which are indeed the diadems of the true elect of God and our Lord;
and because the strong root of your faith, spoken of in days long gone by, endureth even until now, and
bringeth forth fruit to our Lord Jesus Christ, who for our sins suffered even unto death, [but] "whom
God raised from the dead, having loosed the bands of the grave." "In whom, though now ye see Him
not, ye believe, and believing, rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;" into which joy many
desire to enter, knowing that "by grace ye are saved, not of works," but by the will of God through
Jesus Christ. (Epistle to the Philippians, 1)
But He who raised Him up from the dead will raise up us also, if we do His will, and walk in His
commandments, and love what He loved, keeping ourselves from all unrighteousness, covetousness,
love of money, evil speaking, false witness; "not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing," or blow
for blow, or cursing for cursing, but being mindful of what the Lord said in His teaching: "Judge not,
that ye be not judged; forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you; be merciful, that ye may obtain mercy;
with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again;" and once more, "Blessed are the poor,
and those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of God." (Epistle to the
Philippians, 2)
"But the love of money is the root of all evils."1 Knowing, therefore, that "as we brought nothing into
the world, so we can carry nothing out," let us arm ourselves with the armour of righteousness; and let
us teach, first of all, ourselves to walk in the commandments of the Lord. Next, [teach] your wives [to
walk] in the faith given to them, and in love and purity tenderly loving their own husbands in all truth,
and loving all [others] equally in all chastity; and to train up their children in the knowledge and fear of
God. Teach the widows to be discreet as respects the faith of the Lord, praying continually for all,
being far from all slandering, evil-speaking, false-witnessing, love of money, and every kind of evil;
knowing that they are the altar of God, that He clearly perceives all things, and that nothing is hid from
Him, neither reasonings, nor reflections, nor any one of the secret things of the heart. (Epistle to the
Philippians, 4)
If we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future world, according as He has
promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, "we shall
also reign together with Him," provided only we believe. In like manner, let the young men also be
blameless in all things, being especially careful to preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a
bridle, from every kind of evil. For it is well that they should be cut off from the lusts that are in the
world, since "every lust warreth against the spirit;" and "neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God," (Epistle to the Philippians, 5)

Interestingly enough, it was not just writings from Polycarp that refute sola fide; letters written to Polycarp also
refute such. Ignatius of Antioch, in his Epistle to Polycarp affirmed the concept of gracious merit:
Please ye Him under whom ye fight, and from whom ye receive your wages. Let none of you be found
a deserter. Let your baptism endure as your arms; your faith as your helmet; your love as your spear;
your patience as a complete panoply. Let your works be the charge assigned to you, that ye may
receive a worthy recompense. Be long-suffering-, therefore, with one another, in meekness, as God is
towards you. May I have joy of you for ever! (6.2)
The term translated as "charge assigned to you" is δεποσιτα (whence "deposit"), with such works being said to
be "worthy" (αξιος) of an ακκεπτα ("recompense"), which, per BDAG, refers to "military finance: a sum
credited to a Roman soldier and paid upon his discharge."
Another text from this short epistle that refutes Sola Fide and forensic models of the atonement and justification
from Polycarp’s Epistle to the Philadelphians is chapter 10, "Exhortation to the practice of virtue":

Stand fast, therefore, in these things, and follow the example of the Lord, being firm and unchangeable
in the faith, loving the brotherhood, and being attached to one another, joined together in the truth,
exhibiting the meekness of the Lord in your intercourse with one another, and despising no one. When
you can do good, defer it not, because "alms delivers from death." Be all of you subject one to
another "having your conduct blameless among the Gentiles," that ye may both receive praise for your
good works, and the Lord may not be blasphemed through you. But woe to him by whom the name of
the Lord is blasphemed! Teach, therefore, sobriety to all, and manifest it also in your own conduct.
(ANF 1:35)

The note from the editors of the Schaff series, following the quotation in bold provides Polycarp is referencing
“Tobit iv. 10, Tobit xii. 9.” Let us quote from these texts from the book of Tobit:

For almsgiving delivers from death and keeps you from going into the Darkness. (Tobit 4:10 NRSV)

For almsgiving saves from death and purges away every sin. Those who give alms will enjoy a full life.
(Tobit 12:9)

There is a variation in the Greek of Tobit 12:9. The New English Translation of the Septuagint (S) renders the
verse as:

For almsgiving delivers from death, and it will purge away every sin. Those who practice almsgiving
and righteousness will have fullness of life.

It is clear that Polycarp is teaching that almsgiving is an instrumental means of God purging away our sins, all
the more strengthened by the use of Tobit which explicitly teaches this. For more on this issue, see David J.
Downs, Alms: Charity, Reward, and Atonement in Early Christianity (Baylor University Press, 2016)

Additionally, note the following comment from two biblical scholars writing on the
nature of the atonement with respect to related sacrificial terminology used in the
gospels, including the Isa 53:10 text quoted above:
If the Johannine formula, “who takes away sin,” is understood as a reference to
the “Servant of God,” it must be recalled that neither in vv. 4 nor 21 of Is 53 is the
verb nāsā accompanied by the phrase, “upon himself,” in spite of the Greek
translation in verse 4, tas hamartias hēmōn ferei, “he carries our sins.” When
Matthew applies the statement of Is 53:4 to Christ, he wishes to say that he took
away our illnesses, not that he took them upon himself.91 The same meaning is
found in the Exultet of the Paschal liturgy: “he is the true Lamb who took away
(absulit) the sins of the world,” and in the Epistle to the Hebrews: “Thus Christ
offered once for the taking-away of the sins of many, a second time—without
sin—will be seen to those awaiting for salvation” [Heb 9:28]. (Stanislas Lyonnet
and Léopold Sabourin, Sin, Redemption, and Sacrifice: A Biblical and Patristic
Study [Analetcta Biblica Investigationes Scientificae In Res Biblicas 48; Rome:
Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1970], 40)
While (correctly) rejecting one error (i.e., the more forensic models of atonement,
especially Penal Substitution), Terryl and Fiona Givens, and other like-minded modern
Latter-day Saints empty the atonement of its other purposes, including the personal (not
purely forensic/legal92) appeasing of God due to the personal offense of sin. 

Footnote:

92 Blake Ostler, a well-respected Latter-day Saint philosopher (and a friend), while rejecting concept of
propitiation in the atonement (Ostler follows C.H. Dodd in that respect), is nevertheless correct in arguing that
Latter-day Saint theology is inconsistent with the common Reformed models of the atonement, notwithstanding
their popularity among many within the membership of the Church. As Ostler wrote:

Does Mormonism Add Anything to the Penal-Substitution Theory?

Mormon discussions of atonement usually assume the Penal-Substitution Theory (PST) that is the
mainstay of evangelical thought (see, for example, Hyrum L. Andrus, God, Man, and the Universe,
chs. 15 and 165; Boyd K. Packer, “The Mediator”; Ronald A. Heiner, “The Necessity of a Sinless
Messiah,” 5-30). This theory maintains that sin is like a debt that someone must pay, and so Christ pays
it as a third-party benefactor. This payment is made by Christ because he has amassed super-abundant
credit to his mortal life. God’s justice is seen as necessarily retributive in nature so that someone has to
be punished to satisfy God’s just nature. However, for some inexplicable reason, it doesn’t have to be
the sinner that is punished for his or her own sins. Rather, someone else can be punished to satisfy the
demands of justice. Thus, the father punishes Christ in our place.

However, there are numerous problems with PST. These problems include: 
1. It erroneously assumes that justice is a personified platonic absolute that makes demands;
2. It posits a conflict between the wrathful Father who must be persuaded by his living Son
not to punish us;
3. It erroneously assumes that it is just to punish an innocent person in the place of a guilty
person;
4. It assumes that guilt and righteousness can be imputed or transferred from a guilty person to
an innocent person and vice versa;
5. It provides no reason that guilt must be punished and why God cannot just forgive us
without requiring a third-party who committed no sin to suffer;
6. It erroneously analogizes sin to a monetary debt.

. . . However, the question remains: Does Mormon though have the resources to explain or mitigate
these problems with the Penal Substitution Theory? Hyrum Andrus provides perhaps the most
sophisticated version of PST in Mormon writings. He argues:

As a divine being, Christ made an infinite sacrifice in order to pay the debt of sin and give life
and truth and light to man . . . The doctrine of the atonement as expressed in Latter-day
revelation is centered in the immutable requirements of eternal law. The Nephite prophet
Alma taught that both penalty and reward are established for each law that God ordains, and
that each penalty and reward must be “eternal as the life of the soul.” Otherwise, neither
justice nor mercy could have “claim on the creature.” . . . To satisfy the demands of divine
justice and institute a plan of mercy, an atonement had to be made. The Father is a God of
justice; and justice had to be paid. The Father’s will in this regard had to be fulfilled. The
honor and integrity of the Man of Holiness had to be sustained . . . Justice required the Father
to cause the chosen redeemer to suffer. It had to be; truth and consistency made it so. Having
fulfilled the will of the Father, Jesus therefore declared: “I have drunk of that bitter cup which
the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the
world, in which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning” (3 Ne.
11:11; see also John 18:11). (Andrus, God, Man and the Universe, 396-97)

To this point in Andrus’s discussion, he offers a straight-forward argument based on assumptions in
PST. He smuggles in the notion that “Justice had to be paid,” even though not a single Mormon
scripture mentions anything about a money payment in connection with atonement. He posits that the
“demands of justice” require that someone must suffer for sin—even if it is not the person who is guilty
of that sin. There is nothing here to distinguish the discussion from the standard PST. He even drops in
the Anselm’s notion that God’s honor demands payment to be satisfied. None of these assertions have
any scriptural backing.

However, Andrus makes a subsidiary argument that differs from traditional PST. Andrus argues, “For
Jesus to take upon Himself the consequences of sin required that he suffer spiritual death for all men,
and to this end the Spirit of God was withdrawn from him” (Andrus, 441). Spiritual death in Mormon
thought means to be fully cut off from God’s presence. Andrus also argues that such withdrawal of the
Spirit was necessary to test Jesus’s

integrity commensurate with the light and truth he had received from His Father . . . [T]he
withdrawal of spiritual powers enabled Christ to descend below all things so that He could
comprehend all things, and thereby obtain experience and prepare Himself to rescue the
fulness of the Father’s glory in the resurrection. Having acquired the fulness of the Father’s
glory, Jesus could then develop in their fulness the divine attributes and powers of truth, and
light, and life in others . . . [I]n His earthly experience, Jesus learned by direct contact with
mortal weakness and spiritual darkness how to succor his people. (Andrus, 441-42)

The notion that the Atonement was necessary for Christ’s growth and experience is revolutionary.
Rather than a self-sufficient God who dispenses supererogatory merit to others so that the Father
regards them as righteous then they are really sinners, Christ’s suffering is a learning experience to
enable him to empathize with broken humans. The notion that Christ suffered spiritual death—that he
was completely cut off from the Fathers—is also fairly novel. Andrus follows Brigham Young, who
taught that God withdraw his spirit from Jesus in the moment of greatest agony and need so that Christ
could lean from his trials to the greatest extent conceivable (Andrus, 441). However, these
observations by Andrus suggest an approach to the atonement radically different from PST and
not merely an amendment or addition to it. Andrus’s observation suggest a kenotic view of
atonement in which Christ empties himself of the fulness of the divine glory to experience
firsthand the vicissitudes of mortal life. The fact that Christ’s capacity to succor his people increased
because he gained experiential knowledge of the depth of human pain and suffering entails that Christ’s
capacities to love us were increased by the Atonement rather than merely our capacity to repent and be
forgiven. I believe that Andrus offered valuable insights into the nature of Christ’s atonement—
however, those insights have nothing to do with paying a debt of sin owed by another to the
Father. (Blake T. Ostler, Exploring Mormon Thought, Volume 4: God’s Plan to Heal Evil [Salt Lake
City: Greg Kofford Books, 2020], 191-93, emphasis added)
