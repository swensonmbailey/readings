 ABSTRACT

 Possible interpretations of the apparent allusion to a ritual of baptism for the dead are

 investigated. It is concluded that interpretations which deny a water ritual are

 implausible. A vicarious rite, tolerated but not instituted by Paul, was administered in the

 Corinthian church in order to obtain for the dead the benefits Christian initiatory baptism

 obtained for living converts. The most likely beneficiaries were relatives and friends of

 first generation Christians, and adherents to the church who had died without having

 undergone baptism. The perceived need which this ritual addressed came to be met by

 doctrines developing the traditions of Christ's descent to Hades.

 This unique and enigmatic allusion has puzzled scholars and interpreters since the earliest

 centuries of the Church. Writers as early as Tertullian admitted ignorance as to the activity

 designated (Marc. 5.10). While Catholic tradition, later reinforced by Protestant anti-

 sacramental ism, has sought to avoid any reference to an otherwise unknown rite, critical

 scholarship has had to confront the possibility of such an obscure ritual and seek to account

 for it. By some accounts over two hundred explanations have been proffered, but none has

 found wide acceptance.

 This study will consider whether or not the avoidance of acknowledging an otherwise

 unattested ritual can be justified. This requires that the sense in which ol veKpoi is used must

 be considered. Thereafter the connotations of paTrcíÇco will be examined. Consideration will

 then be given to funerary rituals and their significance in the world of early Christianity, in

 order to establish how a Christian ritual such as may be alluded to could have arisen and how

 it would have been understood.

 It is generally assumed that oí veicpoí are human beings who are literally dead (Barrett

 1968, 362). The article and the plural form of the adjective both exclude any interpretation in

 terms of abstract concepts, and require that av^pcorcoi or a similar noun be inferred in

 reading the text (cf. Fee 1987, 763). Figurative interpretations of oi vsicpoi, such as that of

 Murphy-O'Connor who views the term as a pejorative designation of others by the self-styled

 7TV8i)|iaTiKoi (1981, 539), have not found wide support (cf. White 1997). In 1 Cor 15 Paul is

 discussing precisely the subject of resurrection from the dead, and cites the example of the

 death and resurrection of Jesus as the archetype of resurrection from physical death (15:12-

 20). It would therefore seem highly unlikely that oí veKpoi in 15:29 could be a figurative

 designation of any group within the church. Rather, the term refers to deceased human

 beings, and it remains to discover whether it refers specifically to any particular category of

 dead humanity.

 Jeremias argues that the article requires that oí veKpoi refer to a specific group of dead

 people, as a more general sense would have been conveyed simply by veKpoi (1956, 155). 
 FOR THE DEAD?

 Three more specific interpretations have been offered in recent scholarship: (i) deceased

 Christians (Barrett 1968, 363; Conzelmann 1975, 275; Fee 1987, 767; Jeremias 1956, 155-

 56; Lampe 1967, 94; Reaume 1995; Robertson and Plummer 1914, 359-360); (ii) others with

 whom the Corinthian Christians were connected (Fee 1987, 767; Horsley 1998, 206); (iii)

 figuratively, of living Corinthian Christians as themselves mortal (Winter 2001, 104; cf.

 Thompson 1964). Before these options can be considered further, we need to consider the

 sense in which ßa7m£cö is used in this verse.

 PaîixiÇco acquired a technical meaning in early Christian parlance, to designate the rite of

 initiation into the Church. Paul uses the term in this technical sense earlier in 1 Corinthians,

 at 1:13-17, as well as in other letters. However, in 10:1-2 Paul uses the same verb in a context

 in which it does not refer to Christian initiation, even if the imagery is informed by the

 Christian rite (cf. Bauer 1979, 132). We therefore cannot assume that pa7ixiÇcû in 1 Cor

 15:29 refers to the Christian initiation ritual, but must consider the full range of meanings

 current in the Greek language at the time.

 While PctTiTÍÇco, meaning literally to dip or immerse, is well attested in surviving Greek

 texts, the majority of occurrences use the term in a figurative rather than a literal sense

 (Oepke 1964, 530). The imagery of submersion in water is nonetheless clear in some cases

 (Hippocrates, Epid. 5.63; Plato, Symp. 176b [go under]; Plotinus, Enn. 1.8.13; Josephus, B.J.

 3.368, 423 [sink], 525 [suffer shipwreck, drown, perish]; A.J. 10.169 [go under]). A sense of

 destruction or overpowering is present in other usages (Philo, Leg. 3.18; Det. 176; Migr. 204

 [destruction]; Contempi 46 [be overwhelmed]; Josephus, B.J. 4.137 [destruction]; Diodorus

 of Sicily 1.73.6; Plutarch, Galb. 21.3 [be overwhelmed]). Murphy-O'Connor, in dependence

 on Oepke (1964), argues that the normative meaning is figurative rather than literal, and

 accordingly translates oi Pa7cxiÇó^£voi in 1 Cor 15:29 as "those being destroyed" (1981,

 534). This is a point to which we shall return.

 PaTTTÍÇco is used of the ritual lustrations practised in Eleusinian, Bacchic, Isis, and Mithras

 cults of the period (Oepke 1964, 530-31). While any dependence between these and Christian

 baptism is now widely discredited, the underlying motif of cleansing common to the

 Hellenistic rites, and the life-giving property attributed to water in the Egyptian (Oepke 1964,

 532), are nonetheless common to these various water rituals, as to Jewish proselyte baptism

 and Christian initiation.

 ßa7rxi^co occurs in three passages in the LXX, and each usage designates what in the

 broadest possible sense can best be described as a purificatory ritual. In 2 (4) Kgs 5:14

 Naaman eparcxiCTCtxo èv xéo 'Iopôávrç. Sirach 34:25 refers to paítxiÇójievoç ànò VEKpoû. In

 Jdt 12:7 Judith èparcxíÇsxo èv xrj mpe^ipoXf) etcì xÍ1ç Turiyrjç xoû uôaxoç. While the case of

 Naaman, a gentile, does not reflect any purification ritual prescribed in the Pentateuch, it is

 nonetheless clearly to be understood in terms of ritual purification, and not of proselyte

 baptism. Purification associated with corpse impurity, and daily lustrations, not unconnected

 with contact with gentiles, in the remaining two passages clearly reflect observance of Torah.

 While it is clear that all three texts use PaTrxíÇcD in a ritual sense, in none of these is the rite

 in any sense initiatory.

 In the NT parcxíÇcD is used in several senses. It is applied to ritual washing by Pharisees

 before meals (Mark 7:4; Luke 11:38), as is the related noun parcxia^ióç (Mark 7:4; Heb

 9:10). PaTixíÇco is used also of the ritual administered by John the Baptist (Matt 3:6, 11, 13,

 14, 16; Mark 1:4, 5, 8, 9; 6:14, 24; Luke 3:7, 12, 16, 21; 7:29, 30; John 1:25, 26, 31, 33; 3:23;

 10:40; Acts 1:5; 11:16; 19:3, 4; cf. Josephus, A. J. 18.117), and the related rite administered

 by Jesus and his disciples (John 3:22, 26; 4:1, 2). The noun paTixia^ia is used predominantly
 for the baptism of John (Matt 3:7; 21:25; Mark 1:4; 1 1:30; Luke 3:3; 7:29; 20:4; Acts 1:22;

 10:37; 13:24; 18:25; 19:3, 4). John the Baptist uses ßaTixi^co figuratively of Jesus' bestowal

 of the Holy Spirit (Matt 3:11, 14; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; John 1:33; cf. Acts 1:5; 11:16).

 paTrcíÇco is used of the rite of Christian initiation (Matt 28:19; Acts 2:38, 41; 8:12, 13, 16, 36,

 38; 9:18; 10:47, 48; 16:15, 33; 18:8; 19:5; 22:16; Rom 6:3; 1 Cor 1:1:14, 16, 17; 12:13; Gal

 3:27; cf. Did. 7; Ign. Smyrn. 8:2), as is ßaTixicfia (Rom 6:4; Eph 4:5; Col 2:12; 1 Pet 3:21).

 Paul uses ßarcxi^co of ritual initiation also to parody divisions in the Corinthian church (1 Cor

 1:13,15). ßctTm^co and ßa7txiana are used together figuratively of Jesus' passion and death

 in Mark 10:38-39 and Luke 12:50. While the verb or the noun on its own could simply reflect

 the figurative meaning identified above, the tautologous expression in these verses clearly

 requires a very specific understanding of ßa7ruia(ia common to author and reader. In the

 markan version this tradition seems to reflect knowledge of the death of James (Acts 12:2),

 and is generally regarded as the creation of the early Church. The texts are suggestive of a

 theology of Christian initiatory baptism akin to that which Paul expounds in Rom 6:3-4

 (Taylor 1959, 441; cf. Fitzmyer 1985, 94-96). ßa7cii(^co is used figuratively also of the

 passing of Israel through the Red Sea (1 Cor 10:2), an image which may derive from

 Christian baptism (Bauer 1979, 132) or from Jewish proselyte traditions (Oepke 1964, 536),

 or from a spiritualised understanding of the exodus (Horsley 1998, 207). On any of these

 interpretations of the text ßarcxi^co has overtones of initiation analogous to Christian baptism.

 Finally, there is the occurrence of ßarcxi^co in 1 Cor 15:29.

 The overwhelming majority of occurrences of ßa7ixi^co both in the LXX and in early

 Christian literature concern ritual immersion of all or part of the (living) human body in

 water. While all Christian occurrences identified above either deal directly with ritual

 immersion, or use ßcxTtxi^co in a figurative sense derived from ritual immersion, they do not

 all concern Christian initiatory baptism. However normative a figurative sense of ßaTrxi^co

 may have been in classical Greek (Oepke 1964; Murphy-O'Connor 1981, 534), this is not the

 case with early Christian literature. This does not mean that the technical usage of Christian

 initiation can be assumed in 1 Cor 15:29. However, the context of the verse clearly indicates

 action willfully undertaken by some of the Corinthian Christians; even if ßoiTrxi^onevoi and

 ßaTtxi^ovxai are capable of passive rather than middle interpretation, both the participle and

 the verb denote an active and deliberate response to a particular situation. This suggests that a

 ritual interpretation of ßaTixi^co is more likely than a figurative understanding {pace ,

 Murphy-O'Connor 1981, 534). This does not mean that the ritual alluded to can be identified

 with the Christian rite of initiation attested in Corinth (1 Cor 1:13-17; 12:13; Acts 18:8) and

 elsewhere in early Christianity.

 Some scholars have argued that the dead are not the beneficiaries of vicarious baptism, but

 rather that the influence of the deceased or the attachment of living pagans to them led the

 latter to undergo baptism (Jeremias 1956, 156; Raeder 1955; Reaume 1995). imep is rendered

 "on account of' rather than "on behalf of' in such an interpretation. The force of such an

 argument would be that the baptism referred to was regular Christian initiation, motivated by

 a relationship between the initiate and the deceased, and not by conversion to the Gospel.

 While it would be entirely logical that such initiates might deny resurrection as Paul had

 taught it, at the same time they could not hope to achieve reunion with the deceased through

 baptism unless they believed that there was some form of afterlife attained through Christian

 baptism. While it has been noted above that Paul is pointing out inconsistency between belief

 and practice, the attribution of affective if not sentimental motives for undergoing baptism

 would seem culturally anachronistic. Furthermore, such an understanding of the text was not apparent to as early an interpreter as Tertullian (Marc. 5:10), and would not account for the

 emergence of later Gnostic and Marcionite posthumous initiatory baptism (John Chrysostom,

 Horn. 1 Cor. 40.1; Epiphanius, Pan. 28.6.4). It is therefore more likely that ímép is to be

 understood as "on behalf of', and that the deceased are the intended beneficiaries of the

 ritual. Before discussing this point further it is necessary to consider rites of passage

 accompanying death in the world of early Christianity.

 It needs to be observed at this point that early Christian baptism does not belong to the

 same ritual category as funeral rites. The latter, together with cultic activities accompanying

 birth, puberty, and marriage, are rites of passage which represent transitional stages in the

 continuum of the life cycle of a particular culture. While baptism may have become such a

 rite of passage in christianised societies at a later stage, it was not so during the early years of

 the Church. Irrespective of whether the early Church baptised infants, baptism was

 essentially a conversion-initiation rite. Baptism represented not a transition in an essentially

 continuous life cycle, but the fundamental disruption of that cycle through the acquisition of

 a new and alien identity through incorporation into a new community (Christiansen 1995, 41;

 Taylor 1992, 100). We therefore cannot simply assume that the rite of Christian initiation

 could or would have been appropriated and adapted as a funeral rite.

 That rituals were performed on behalf of the deceased can scarcely be doubted. These

 would have been understood as an essential accompaniment and effective aid to the transition

 from terrestrial life through death to whatever form of existence was believed to follow (cf.

 De Maris 1995, 663, 675-76). The sin offering on behalf of those killed in battle recorded in

 2 Macc 12:43-45 indicates that in Judaism vicarious rituals for the deceased were

 conceivable, and that analogous practices in the early Church cannot be excluded (Hays

 1997, 267). We are concerned here not so much with the specific conceptions of an afterlife,

 whether resurrection or immortality, physical or spiritual, as with ways in which living

 relations of the deceased sought to expedite their transition to that state. De Maris has

 documented a wide range of cultic institutions, including temples to Palaimon (Melikartes),

 Demeter (Eueteria), Persephone (Kore), and Pluto (Hades), in the vicinity of Corinth, all with

 facilities catering for funereal and related rites (1995, 664). He concludes that Roman Corinth

 was unusually preoccupied with death and with making appropriate provision for the passage

 of the deceased to the anticipated afterlife (1995, 670). In addition to these cults, Chow cites

 Lemuria, the exorcism of the ghosts of the deceased from the house to ensure well-being of

 surviving members of the household (1992, 160), as a possible antecedent to a Christian rite

 for the dead in Corinth.

 Meals commemorating the departed are widely attested in the Graeco-Roman world, and

 Meeks has astutely observed that these may have given rise to the later Christian tradition of

 the Requiem (1983, 16). However, in the case of Corinth, it would seem that a rite apparently

 associated with Baptism rather than the Eucharist was practised. While any identification of

 the rite alluded to in 1 Cor 15:29 with Christian baptism would be premature at this point, if

 any point of contact with other known early Christian rituals is found, it would clearly be

 with baptism.

 The notion of post-mortem initiation is not entirely foreign to the world of early

 Christianity. The possibility cannot be excluded that rites such as the Orphic initiation of the

 dead, for their delivery from evil in the afterlife (Orphic frg. 245; Plato, Resp. 364e-365a),

 could reflect a similar ritual and soteriological notion to that behind a practice adopted by

 some Christians in Corinth. The tradition preserved in 1 Pet 3:19-20; 4:6 of Jesus preaching

 to the spirits of the deceased which may be reflected also in John 5:25 (Brown 1966, 215;

 Sanders and Mastin 1968, 168; pace , Barrett 1955, 218) and Eph 4:8-10 (Dunn 1980, 1 86-

 187; Hanson 1980, 126-150; pace , Best 1998, 383-386; cf. Lincoln 1990, 244-247), testifies

 to an early Christian conviction that salvation could be bestowed after death (cf. also Matt 27:

 52-54; Gos. Pet. 10:41; Acts Pil. 25-26; Ign. Magn. 9; Justin, Dial. 72.4; Irenaeus, Haer.

 3.20.4; Clement of Alexandria, Strom. 6.6.44-46; Odes Sol. 22; 42; Aseen. Isa. 4:21; 6-11;

 Sib. Or. 1.376-382). It is perhaps significant that in 1 Peter this tradition should be cited in a

 context in which baptism is also discussed (3:20-22). There are at least four texts which make

 the connection between proclamation of the Gospel to the deceased and baptism very much

 more explicit. In Herm. Sim. 9.16.5-6, baptism is administered by apostles and teachers to the

 souls of the dead in Hades, so effecting their resurrection. In Acts Pil. 27, the righteous

 deceased, risen from the dead, are baptised before proclaiming the resurrection of Jesus. In

 Sib. Or. 8.310-317 the account of the descent of Jesus to Hades alludes to baptism preceding

 the resurrection of the deceased. In Ep. Apos. 27 Jesus refers to himself having baptised the

 patriarchs and prophets during his descent to Hades.

 As noted above, vicarious baptism for the dead is attested at a later period among Gnostics

 and Marcionites (John Chrysostom, Horn. 1 Cor. 40.1; Epiphanius, Pan. 28.6.4). While

 Jeremias may be correct in arguing that the Gnostic rite derived from a misinterpretation of 1

 Cor 1 5:29 (1956, 1 55), divisions between orthodoxy and heresy defined at a later date cannot

 be used to determine whether these rites had any antecedents in first century Christianity.

 Tertullian admits to not knowing what rite Paul refers to in 1 Cor 15:29 {Marc. 5.10), and

 cites the Roman Februarian lustrations as an analogy to the rite he postulates behind the text.

 This indicates that any ritual practised in Corinth during the first century had long fallen into

 abeyance by the end of the second. It suggests also that the rite was never widely observed in

 the Church, as Tertullian had no further information about it apart from the allusion in 1 Cor

 15:29, and could draw no analogy from customs practised in other churches. This strongly

 indicates that Paul himself did not conceive or introduce this ritual, or it would have become

 more widespread. The rite therefore presumably reflects an initiative on the part of some

 Corinthian Christians themselves, even if the influence of Apollos cannot be excluded.

 The evidence points, at least provisionally, to a ritual which did not become normative in

 the early Church, irrespective of whether Paul approved of it (cf. Barrett 1968, 363; Beasley-

 Murray 1962, 190; Dunn 1970, 104-105, 119; Fee 1987, 767; Hays 1997, 267; Oepke 1964,

 542). The evidence nevertheless points strongly to a ritual interpretation of 1 Cor 15:29, and

 to a rite whose intended beneficiaries were not those who underwent it but dead people,

 whom we need still to identify. "All the numerous attempts to explain away the obvious

 sense of this verse are strained and unpersuasive" (Hays 1997, 267; cf. Fee 1987, 763-6).

 This does not mean that the "normal Pauline meaning" of baptism (Barrett 1968, 362), as

 initiation into the Church, with its soteriological connotations, can be assumed. The

 assumption that "this baptism, performed as objectively as a sacrifice for the dead, must

 presumably have the like signification as baptism of the living" (Beasley-Murray 1962, 190)

 rests not upon exegesis of the text but upon later Protestant, and specifically Baptist,

 interpretations of Christian initiation.

 It is essential that the ritual practised in Corinth be understood within its own cultural

 context, and not in terms of later western rationalist thinking which, at the least, separates

 rituals from the spiritual realities they represent. While description of the early Christian

 understanding of baptism as "sacramental ist" may be anachronistic and pejorative, it nonetheless recognises that rituals were understood to be real and effective means of harnessing and transmitting

divine power for particular purposes. Paul's use of the imagery of baptism in 1 Cor 1:13-17

may well "imply a rather strongly sacramental stance toward baptism . .. with some

apparently magical implications" (Fee 1987, 767), in terms of which the importance and

power of the administrator of the ritual were emphasised. Nevertheless, the sense of divine

power actually transmitted through the ritual should not be regarded as at all unusual in the

early Christian understanding of baptism (cf. Horsley 1998, 207). This applies as much to

Paul himself as to the Corinthian Christians (Bornkamm 1971, 189), and so far as rituals

undergone on behalf of the dead are concerned, "Paul is at the very least open to believing

hat the community can act meaningfully on behalf of those who are not able to act on their

own behalf' (Hays 1997, 267; cf. Barrett 1968, 363; Oepke 1964, 542).

What seems clear about the Corinthian ritual is that it was performed on behalf of dead

people, and that at least some of those who underwent it in some way denied the resurrection

at

(cf. Chow 1992, 163; Tuckett 1996). Rather than absolute denial of resurrection, the issues

concern its physical nature and logical and chronological relation to physical death (cf.

Horsley 1978; Hurd 1983, 197; Thiselton 1978; Tuckett 1996; Wedderburn 1987). While

iS

Paul is clearly drawing attention to the inconsistency between belief and practice (Robertson

and Plummer 1914, 359-360; Soards 1999, 338), the issue concerning the afterlife should be

understood as concerning the form it took and its relationship with the physical body, and

whether resurrection as Paul had proclaimed it was compatible with conceptions of time,

eternity, and immortality prevalent in Corinth

Some scholars have argued that the rite referred to in 1 Cor 15:29 derived from a non-

a

Christian mystery cult (Oepke 1964, 542; cf. Chow 1992, 160). It is clear from such passages

as 1 Cor 8:1-13; 10:1-14 that "some who participated in the cultic life of the Corinthian

church associated also with pagan cults" (Taylor 1995, 131). It is clear also from1 Cor

14:23-24 that Önotol were present at Christian worship (cf. Chow 1992; Hurd 1983; Taylor

995; Willis 1985). We therefore cannot assume that all who worshipped in the church of

Corinth were exclusively committed to the Christian Gospel and community. However, the

force of Paul's argument requires that those whose inconsistency is referred to could be

identified unequivocally with the church. An origin of the rite outside the church is therefore

not likely, even if it was influenced by thought and observances prevalent in society at the

time.

It is generally accepted that the rite referred to in 1 Cor 15:29 was in some sense vicarious

(Barrett 1968, 363; Chow 1992, 144; Conzelmann 1975, 276; Dunn 1998, 449; Tuckett 1996.

269; Wedderburn 1987, 287-293).

presumably performed on on an understanding that the

was

ritual was in and of itself effective in the procurement of salvation for the deceased person on

whose behalf it it was undergone (cf. Chow 1992, 144; Hurd 1983, 136). The fact that the rite

evidently fell into abeyance by the middle of the second century the latest (apart from

at

possibly related Marcionite and Gnostic posthumous initiations), without having become â

widespread custom in the Church, suggests that it addressed perceived needs unique to the

earliest generations of Christianity, and possibly needs that were particularly acutely

perceived in Corinth The eschatological orientation of the first generation of Christians

(Taylor 1999) and the nature of new religious communities suggest themselves as

circumstances which could have generated the climate in which such a rite was conceivable

and considered desirable. The formation of communities of converts implies that members

would have had deceased relatives who had not

heard the Gospel proclaimed, and had not

been initiated into the Church or into salvation as conceived in Christian terms. Kinship loyalties would have conflicted with the exclusive claims of the Church to salvation through

Christ, and generated a dissonance which could potentially be resolved through contriving a

a

vicarious and posthumous initiation ritual (cf. Taylor 1998), For this reason, some scholars

argue that the baptism alluded to in 1 Cor 15:29 was undergone by some Corinthian

Christians in order to procure salvation for deceased relatives and friends (Fee 1987, 767;

Horsley 1998, 206).

Another possible explanation of the vicarious baptismal rite is that the intended

beneficiaries were unbaptised Christians (Barrett 1968, 363; Conzelmann 1975, 275; Fee

1987, 767; Lampe 1967, 94). Given the lack of evidence for any protracted catechumenate

during the earliest years of the Church, this is a line of argument which needs to be more

carefully nuanced. It needs to be recognized that the early Christian communities attracted

adherents who were not converted in the sense of becoming initiated into the Church. As

noted above, the reference to ărioto1 present in gatherings of the church in I Cor 14:22-23

(cf. i8tôrau in vy, 16, 23; Conzelmann 1975, 238-42; Fee 1987, 682-84; Hays 1997, 237;

Soards 1999, 295; Taylor 1995, 132) testifies to this. This suggests degrees of adherence by

tO

uninitiated and unconverted or not fully converted worshippers observers on the periphery

or

of early Christian communities (cf. Taylor 1995).

It is entirely possible that uninitiated adherents to the Corinthian church included not only

tO

prospective converts but others who had no intention of pledging absolute allegiance and

undergoing baptism. Christian exclusivity could have posed an obstacle to the exercise of

civic office, which would have had serious consequences for Christians not of Jewish origin

Similarly, slaves and other subordinate members of of households may not have had the liberty

to renounce pagan cults before undergoing baptism during their lifetime (cf. Fox 1986, 297:

Horrell 1996, 91-198; Meeks 1983, 9-73; Taylor 1995; Winter 2001). The possibility needs

to be considered that a means was sought to make the benefits of baptism available to some

of these after their deaths.

Another possibility which needs to be considered is that the ritual was not initiatory at all,

but funerary. The issue may not be whether or not the deceased had been baptised into the

or

Church, but how the transition through death from mortality to resurrection was to be

accomplished.De Maris has argued that 1 Cor 15:29 reflects a Corinthian Christian rite

whereby the passage of deceased members of the church to resurrection was expedited (1995,

575-676). Horsley has argued similarly that this rite freed the soul of the deceased from the

body (1998, 207). One does not have to follow his interpretation of the problem behind 1 Cor

to

15 (Horsley 1978) to recognise the merit in his argument. It is not obvious why a ritual

S

similar to initiatory baptism should have been chosen for this purpose, but note should be

taken of the eschatological overtones of Baptism in Eph 5:25-27. Irrespective of whether this

is an authentic pauline text, the relationship between the individual and the Church as a

whole, and the process from the death of Jesus to the eschatological consummation of the

marriage between Christ and the Church, creates a conceptual framework in which such a rite

a

in

might have been conceivable.

De Maris argues that in Rom 6:3-4 Paul reflects upon and inverts the theology behind the

Corinthian funerary custom (1995, 681-682). His thesis is at this point imaginative beyond

falsification, and has been criticised particularly by White (1997). It should be noted also

that, if the ritual was funerary, the corpse could have been immersed in water, and it would

not have been necessary for a living friend or relative to undergo the rite on behalf of the

deceased. As noted above, the analogy between baptism and death is found also in Mark

10:38-39 and Luke 12:50. The latter text, while locating the saying in different context, is nonetheless probably dependent on Mark (cf. Fitzmyer 1985, 94-96; Taylor 1959, 441).It

has,so far as 1 am aware, never been argued that Mark is dependent on Paul at this particular

1

point. It is more likely that Romans on the one hand and Mark and Luke on the other

represent independent attestations of an early Christian mystical association of baptism with

the death of Jesus. If this tradition entered the funeral rites of the Corinthian or any other

church during the middle decades of the first century, it is likely that such a custom would

have persisted and been more widely adopted in the early Church. The growing influence of

Paul, and the symbolism evoked by the ritual, would have ensured its survival.

It is unlikely that 1 Cor 15:29 can simply be explained as reflecting a Corinthian Christian

1

uneral rite. The ritual, while undoubtedly having funereal overtones, must have had

a

narrower purpose than the transition of deceased Christians to immediate or eschatological

resurrection. We need therefore to return to the question of posthumous initiatory baptism,

and restrict the funereal rite to persons who had died unbaptised. We should presumably

assume also either that the church did not have access to the corpse, and hence substituted a

living proxy, or that it was believed that once the soul had left the body the latter could no

longer receive benefits on behalf of the former. Two categories of intended beneficiaries

were identified above, deceased relatives of Corinthian Christians and adherents of the

church who died unbaptised. The first has the advantage of explaining, at least partially, why

the ritual fell into abeyance within a very few generations. The intended beneficiaries could

have been long deceased, with no pnysical remains upon which the ritual could be performed

As the Church became increasingly a self-perpetuating body, there would have been fewer

families entering Christian fellowship for the first time As the Church was no longer

dependent on new converts to sustain it, it had less need to cater for the perceived needs of

to

such converts to include their forebears in the salvation they themselves had acquired in

Christ. Traditions of the proclamation of the Gospel by Christ in Hades could also have

provided an alternative means to achieving this purpose. On the other hand, the emergence of

to

the catechumenate and deferred baptism would have enabled believers constrained not to

undergo baptism by civic obligations or domestic circumstances to avail themselves of the

ritual when at liberty to do so. At the same time, persecution and the growth of the Christian

martyr radition would have caused the Church to define its boundaries more rigidly, and to

O

become less tolerant of liminal adherence

In conclusion, it seems clear that 1 Cor 15:29 alludes to a Corinthian Christian ritual

intended to avail salvation in Christ to persons who had died unbaptised. The most likely

intended beneficiaries of this rite are deceased relatives of converts to Christianity and

adherents to the Corinthian church who did not undergo baptism during their lifetime. It is

less likely to have been a funeral rite for baptised Christians. The fact that the rite did not

persist in the early Church, and seems not to have been widely adopted, suggests that the

second and successive generations of Christians found other means of attaining the objective

of the ritual more acceptable and more expedient. The catechumenate would have made

individual profession of faith more central to initiation into the Church than it had been in

earlier days. The notion of Christ's proclamation of the Gospel to the deceased in Hades

would have been more compatible with this development than ritual incorporation of the dead

into the Church.

The Corinthian church, or some members thereof, devised a rite of vicarious baptism for

a

the dead, seeking to include the deceased in the salvation they had attained in Christ.

A lternative interpretations have been found to be unconvincing, but specific details of the

ritual continue to evade reconstruction. Two particular categories of intended beneficiaries have been identified, and some account of why the rite fell into abeyance has been given.

Further certainty on this issue in the future will depend on in formation not currently

available. Any further illumination of this rite could potentially inform our understanding" not

only of early Christian baptismal practice, but also of popular conceptions of death and

afterlife, and of the impact of conversion to Christianity on family relations in the Graeco-

Roman world.
