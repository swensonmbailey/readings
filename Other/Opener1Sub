The Trinity did not come to be out of a necessity to say to the world that though they see Jesus
Christ as God, the Father as God, and the Holy Spirit as God, that they still believe in one God
Though this need was considered, after all, the Hebrews worshipped and believed in one God, it
wasn't the case. Rather, the Trinity is plainly and solely scriptural. The very essence or substance
of the Triune God is all three persons. One God, three persons. So when Nicaea came around and
the bishops sought to close the case of Arianism, homoousios was the one word that did, It
effectually solidified the past four years 'worth of teachings of God's essence or or substance by
taking the pre-niceae church's concept of God's unique substance and putting a word to it
Homoousios means "one substance,' or "same substance." Jesus is the same substance as the
Father. The reason substance was a huge deal was because the understanding was that there were
two substances. One of creation: angels, spirits, souls, the earth, and the heaven and one of God
They did not see God to be of the same substance that all of creation comprises. They easily
understood this because God is the creator of all things and is independent of His creation
Nothing or no one created God or Jesus. 'They never came

last. 'They are the father of eternity.
Revelation 4:11 - ""Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for
-
you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created." The fact all things came
into existence Is al powerful claim. It's one thing to say all things were created. My opponent
believes this. But to him and hiS doctrine, we are all eternal because our intelligences are eternal.
So, that means we never came into existence through God's will, whether that be the Father, or
the Son, or the Holy Spirit. We were created, as per LDS doctrine, but we did not come into
existence per Rev 11, which contradicts their nature of the godhead. The very fact ALL THING
came into existence by the will of God means that the creator and creature distinction is
warranted, even if my opponent wants to argue Greek philosophy distorted Christianity, which
he's done time and again.
To add, John 1:3-"All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made
hat was made." And Colossians 1:16 - "For by him all things were created, in heaven and on
earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities allthings
were created through him and for him.

For instance, Athenagoras would then add about the substance of God: "We acknowledge a God and a Son his Logos, Athenagoras and a Holy Spirit, united in substance.
Justin Martyr says, asserted that this Power F Christ] was begotten from the Father, but not
bya abscission [i.e. cutting offl. as if the: substance of the Father were divided. (Dialogue with
Trypho, a Jew 128)
And Athenagoras, "We are not atheists ... because we acknowledge one God, uncreated, eternal
by whom the universe has been created through his Logos.... We acknowledge a Son of God
...
Nor let anyone think it ridiculous that God should have a Son... The Son of God is the Logos of
the Father... T he Nous [mind] and Logos of the Father is the Son of God. (ibid. 10)
Now, Jesus is the Logos of God John 1:1 outright says it. But what does that mean? It means
it.
that Jesus was the reason, wisdom, and logic of God. Take, for instance, Tertullian's explanation
in Against Praxeas, "Observe, then, that when you are silently conversing with yourself, this very
process is carried on within you by your reason, which meets you with a word at every
movement of your thought ... Whatever you think, there is a word ... You must speak it in your
mind ... Thus, in a certain sense the word is a second person within you, through which m
thinking you utter speech ... The word is itself a different thing from yourself. Now how much

more fully is is all this transacted in God, whose image and likeness you are?"
The Word was with God, and that is to mean in in His mind, as his reason and logic and the Word
was God, that is to say, He is of the same substance. Logically, if the Father begot the Logos,
who is His literal Word and logic, then that would make him God, L.E. the same substance.
The LDS agrees with the statement that Christ is God's logic, Elder Bruce R. MeConkie taught:
R.
"Christ is the Word or Messenger of Salvation. Thus, John's meaning is: 'In pre-existence was
Christ, and Christ was with the Father, and he, the Son, had himself also attained godhood. 'I. V
John 1:1-2; D&C 93:7-8. The Gospel of John calls Jesus the Word (see John 1:1; logos in
Greek), a complex philosophical term that basically means the divine principle of reason that
brings order to the universe and links the human mind with deity.
to
Let's skip the fact that Elder Bruce said that Jesus had attained godhood, and acknowledge the
fact they see the logos as God's reason To this, 1 quote John of Damascus, "As long as you say
that Christ is 1S the Word of God and Spirit, why do you accuse us of being Associators? For the
word, and the spirit, is inseparable from that in which it naturally has existence. Therefore, if the
Word of God is in God, then it is obvious that He is God. If, however, He is outside of God
then, according to to you, God is without word and without spirit. Consequently, by avoiding the
introduction of an associate with God, you have mutilated Him. It would be far better for you to
say that He has an associate than to mutilate Him, as if you were dealing with a stone or a piece
of wood or some other inanimate object. Thus, you speak untruly when you call us Hetaeriasts;
we retort by calling you Mutilators of God.
Despite St. John of Damascus arguing against Muslims who see Jesus as a mere man, wholly
separate and whose existence is independent from God the Father, we can apply the same
standard toward the LDS, whose Jesus 'existence or his godhood, is independent even though
they agree with the above saying "the word was with God and the Word was God." and "The Father is in me and I in the Father." If Jesus is not the second person of the Trinity and
vigorously the only God, then we have mutilated God by stripping the Father of His Word
Jesus said, "I and the Father are one." The Jews understood this mean He was claiming to be
God, because Christ Jesus likened Himself to be one with Father. They did not accuse Him of
being (a) god by THE God. Jesus also adds, "The Father is in me and I in Him."
Not only is Jesus homoousios with the Father, but Jesus is homoousios with us. This is what I
want to end my opener with. It is only through the Orthodox christian framework that melds
together the gospel. That God took on flesh and saved us from our sins. But it wasn't because of
some created a creature that Arianism taught or some separate god, whose stature isn't that of the
highest, such as my opponent has said and believes, that has saved us. It is that of God, the
Word, the Logos, that took on flesh. By taking on our flesh, He has joined both man and God to
be in communion again. Through faith, God adopts us through Christ as Children of God. Christ
uS
joins us with the divine essence because by putting on Christ; we are have become homoousios
with God Himself. This is IS possible because of Christ's one substance with the Father, the
uncreated God. Since He is of the same substance, and since He took on flesh, which is the same
substance of us, we are now joined with God Himself!
John 14:20"-At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."
